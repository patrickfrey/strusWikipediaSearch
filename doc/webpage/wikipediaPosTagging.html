		<h1>Part of speech tagging of the Wikipedia collection for information retrieval</h1>

<h2>Intention</h2>
<p class="description">
The part of speech tagging of the Wikipedia collection for the <i>Strus</i> search engine intends to address the needs of a search engine only.
It is not a general purpose approach and not a start to such an approach. An attempt to take this POS tagging as base for other purposes will most likely fail.
The POS tagging implemented here aims to distinguish between verbs, adverbs and adjectives, nouns and entities and it tries to resolve personal pronoun references.
Not more.
</p>

<h2>Tags</h2>
<p class="description">
The following list describes the tags assigned to words or sequences of words in a document. The base document structure is the one described <a href="wikipediaToXML.html">here</a>.
The POS tags are assigned to content to '&lt;text&gt;' tags. The assignements of the tags is flat, there are no structures described with the tags. 
Every element or sequence of elements is uniquely tagged by POS tags. A POS tag is one of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>V</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verb</li>
<li><b>A</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adverb or adjectiv</li>
<li><b>E</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sequence of names forming a named entity identified by some heuristics. An entity 'E' tag may have an id attribute with the complete name referred to, if the name in the tag is not complete.</li>
<li><b>N</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sequence of nouns forming a noun entity identified by some heuristics.</li>
<li><b>C</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counter or number.</li>
<li><b>R</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal pronoun reference with an id attribute with the text of the entity referred to, e.g. "because &lt;R id=&apos;Mick Jagger&apos;&gt;he&lt;/R&gt; was"</li>
<li><b>P</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punctuation marker splitting different parts of a sentence (tag without content, e.g. '&lt;P/&gt;'</li>
<li><b>T</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentence termination marker (tag without content, e.g. '&lt;T/&gt;'</li>
</ul>
The tag names do not correspond to <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">the Penn Treebank tag names</a> 
because this would be misleading. The reduction to a small set of tags is intentional here.
</p>

<h2>Conversion</h2>
<p class="description">
The enriching of the Wikipedia collection english with POS tags is part of the conversion process of the Wikimedia format, but it is separated from it.
The basic POS tagging was done with a script using the output of <a href="https://spacy.io">SpaCy</a> and some heuristics to resolve entities referenced by partial names or personal pronouns.
</p>

<h2>Complexity</h2>
<p class="description">
The conversion of the Wikipedia collection English on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6800K CPU 3.40GHz with 64 G RAM and a GTX 1060 GPU will presumably last 2 - 3 weeks. 
Detailed numbers will follow.
</p>

<h2>Work in progress</h2>
<p class="description">
This document and the POS tagging is work in progress. Example documents and more description will follow.
