		<h1>Measuring query throughput</h1>
		<p class="description">
		Measuring the query preformance is a delicate thing with a big danger of producing biased results.
		We provide here some numbers without intending to compare <i>Strus</i> with other systems.
		The test just gives you a hint about the quantity structure you can handle with
		a search index of the size of Wikipedia English with <i>Strus</i> on an Intel NUC.
		Nothing more. The main intention is to convince people to give it a change rather than giving
		a base for a business decision. For a decision you need a fair comparison.
		This is not provided here.
		<br/>Nevertheless this test shows more than a statement like: 
		<i>This engine processes bla bla gigabytes of (unspecified) data per second on hardware
		you can rent or buy</i>.
		<br/>We will run two small tests (each of them with only 1600 queries)
		on the <i>Wikipedia</i> demo search solution with all
		involved services written in <i>Python</i> with all the involved weighting 
		and summarization functions used.
		<br/>
		The system was not at all optimized for this case.
		Before running the test the storage servers were restarted.
		<br/>
		You have to take into account here that the <i>Strus</i> Wikipedia demo system, makes
		a preselection on title features only if your query consists of only high frequent 
		terms (stopwords) like for example "to be".
		</p>

		<h1>Test with BM25</h1>
		<p class="description">
		The first test runs 1600 random generated BM25 queries, 800 of them single term, 800 of them
		with two query terms. The queries were built from randomly selected words starting with a
		capital letter from the forward index of the index dump. The two term queries are built from
		words appearing at least once as a sequence in the index.

		<p class="description">
		The query terms have the following distribution of document frequencies:
		</p>
		<img src="images/benchmark_df_histogram_BM25pff.png" width="560" alt="distribution of query term document frequencies" /></a>
		<p class="description">
		</p>

		<h1>Setting</h1>
		<p class="description">
		Each test was splitted into 8 scripts, each script running 200 queries of the form:
		<pre>
		wget --quiet -O tmp/output.P.1.htm 'http://demo.project-strus.net/query?s=BM25&q=Mexican'
		</pre>
		where 'Mexican' is the query in this example. I run these 8 scripts in parallel from my
		laptop. The test scripts are part of the strusWikipedia project in the subdirectory <i>benchmarks/parallelQueries</i>.
		Each test run produces 8 real time measurements from which we take the highest one as the total
		running time to get the number of queries executed per second.
		</p>

		<h1>Results</h1>
		<h2>BM25</h2>
		<p class="description">The test with the BM25 query evaluation scheme produced the following numbers:
		</p>
		<input class="toggle-box" id="timeBM25" type="checkbox" >
		<label for="timeBM25">Time series for the BM25 tests</label>
		<pre>
		real 41.68
		real 42.14
		real 42.45
		real 42.65
		real 42.86
		real 42.88
		real 43.09
		real 44.62
		</pre>
		<p class="description">The longest time for a set of 200 queries was 44.62 seconds.
		So we get
		<pre>
		1600 / 44.62 = 35.8
		44.620 / 1600 = 27.8 E-3
		</pre>
		meaning 35 queries per second or 28 ms per query
		</p>

		<h2>BM25pff</h2>
		<p class="description">The test with the BM25pff (with proximity) 
		query evaluation scheme produced the following numbers:
		</p>
		<input class="toggle-box" id="timeBM25pff" type="checkbox" >
		<label for="timeBM25pff">Time series for the BM25pff tests</label>
		<pre>
		real 128.92
		real 130.53
		real 130.65
		real 131.89
		real 132.22
		real 132.23
		real 132.48
		real 132.60
		</pre>
		<p class="description">The longest time for a set of 200 queries was 132.60 seconds.
		So we get
		<pre>
		1600 / 132.60 = 12.1
		132.60 / 1600 = 82.8 E-3
		</pre>
		meaning 12 queries per second or 83 ms per query. This reflects the intuitive impression,
		that the BM25 with proximity in <i>Strus</i> is about 3 times slower than the native BM25.
		</p>
