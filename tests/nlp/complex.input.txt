I Did It Again ; misc; Background and development; In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional demo . He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a sound engineer . Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls , and there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson or another Tiffany . Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated, It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that. They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from lower and less poppy delivery to distinctively, unmistakably Britney. Spears recorded ten songs with White, including Autumn Goodbye , E-Mail My Heart , From the Bottom of My Broken Heart , I'm So Curious , I Will Still Love You , Luv The Hurt Away , Soda Pop , Thinkin' About You , and You Got It All . The singer also recorded a cover of Sonny & Cher 's 1967 single The Beat Goes On . White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production, while additional production was done by English electronic music group All Seeing I . After hearing the material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm , Sweden , where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled Hit Me Baby One More Time , which was originally written for American Rhythm and blues group TLC ; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit. We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash', revealed the label's A&R executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line Hit Me would condone Domestic violence , and later revised it to ...Baby One More Time . The singer revealed that she didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'. By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oréal . ...Baby One More Time was released as Spears' debut album on January 12, 1999.; ...Baby One More Time liner notes.

It just felt really right. I went into the studio and did my own thing with it, trying to give it a little more attitude than the demo. In 10 days, I never even saw Sweden.

The album opens with the first single ...Baby One More Time , a Teen pop and Dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the Piano . The opening was compared to many other songs, such as We Will Rock You (1977), Start Me Up (1981), These Words (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws due to the fact the track makes its presence known in exactly one second . According to magazine Blender , ...Baby One More Time is composed by wah-wah guitar lines and EKG -machine bass-slaps . Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend. The next song and third single, (You Drive Me) Crazy runs through a moderately slow dance beat , and has a rhythm and blues Melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single Sometimes is a ballad , that Spears begins with You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm. ; After Sometimes is ...Baby One More Time's fourth track, Soda Pop , a song that draws influences from Bubblegum pop and Dancehall , and features background vocals from co-writer Mikey Bassie. Spears' vocals on the fifth track and fourth single, Born to Make You Happy , span more than an Octave . Its lyrics allude to a relationship that a woman desires to repair, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy . The sixth track and final single, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart , is a sentimental slow-tempo Teen pop ballad.; I Will Be There is a Pop rock song that features a guitar riff similar to Natalie Imbruglia 's Torn (1997), with a rousing chorus about standing by your man (or a best friend or a house pet) , as noted by Kyle Anderson of MTV . The eleventh track, E-Mail My Heart , is a sensitive piano ballad where Spears sings, E-mail me back/ And say our love will stay alive . The cover of Sonny & Cher 's 1967 single The Beat Goes On is influenced by Bossa nova and Trip hop , and features a similar sound to spy movies themes.; cite weburl; title; Britney Spears Baby One More Time – Sheet Music; work; Music Notes; publisher; Alfred Music ; accessdate; November 21, 2009; archiveurl; archivedate; 2012-02-25; deadurl; no; cite weburl; title; ...Baby One More Time (US CD Single) – Britney Spears; publisher; AllMusic .

Media director Peter Gardiner explained, Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk . Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was Polaroid and the corporation released the Polaroid i-Zone as the tour's official camera. Spears used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product. The show was divided into segments, separated by interlude, ending with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers . Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs from her second studio album, Oops!...

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars, Billboard s Paul Verna considered the album a top 40-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut .; Kyle Anderson of MTV said he was surprised in more ways than one with his first listening of ...Baby One More Time, commenting he expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos. Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox . Walters also said that while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam. A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career . He also found the album premature, commenting, hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier for it.

Yomiuri Shimbun reported that critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson. Rolling Stone wrote: Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene. Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice. Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice&nbsp;...

Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 25 million albums worldwide . Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry . ...Baby One More Time is Spears' most successful album to date, with worldwide sales over 25 million copies, and also the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.; Folkard, Claire (2003).
