'''Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Да́ниэль Го́тлиб Ме́ссершмидт}}) (September 16, 1685 – March 25, 1735) was a German physician, [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[geographer]]. He was born in [[Danzig]] and studied medicine in [[Jena]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], obtained his [[doctorate degree]] in the latter in 1713 and settled as a medical doctor in [[Danzig]]. In 1716, he came into contact with [[Russia]]n emperor [[Peter the Great]]. By decree of November 5, 1718, Peter gave Messerschmidt the task to ”collect rarities and medicinal plants” from [[Siberia]]. 

Messerschmidt set out in 1720 on his exploration – the first by a [[natural history|naturalist]] in this ''[[terra incognita]]'', which came to last for seven years. He made numerous observations related to [[ethnology]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]] and also excavated the first known [[fossil]] [[mammoth]] remains. Messerschmidt used two simple utensils for collecting data and artefacts, written diary notes and boxes, establishing a tradition for [[natural history|naturalist]] exploration to last for a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = te Heesen | first = Anke | title = Boxes in Nature | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–403 | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0039-3681(00)00017-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tobolsk]], Messerschmidt met the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[lieutenant colonel]] [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]], who had been taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Poltava]] and [[exile]]d to [[Siberia]]. 

Strahlenberg accompanied Messerschmidt during several expeditions and later published some of Messerschmidt’s observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = von Strahlenberg | first = Ph.J. | title = Das Nord- und Östliche Theil von Europa und Asia | year = 1730 | location = Stockholm | url = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Messerschmidt explored lands all the way to [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun]] east of [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Egerton (2008)&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Egerton | first = Frank N. | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 27: Naturalists Explore Russia and the North Pacific During the 1700s | journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1890/0012-9623(2008)89[39:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey, however, exhausted him, and he returned to [[Saint Petersburg]] in February 1728. He never became a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[poverty]] in 1735. 

[[File:Messer0002.jpg|thumb|''Cypripedium macranthon'', described by Messerschmidt]]
Messerschmidt’s notes and collections were, to the degree they were preserved, kept at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. [[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]] cited extracts of his journey log in his ''Neue nordischen Beyträge''. Only much later, his full journal and excellent maps were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = D.G. | title = Forschungsreise durch Sibirien 1720–1727, vol. 1–5, edited by E.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deer in the Works''' is a short story by [[Kurt Vonnegut]].  It first appeared in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in April 1955, and was anthologized in ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marc|first=Leeds|last2=Reed|first2=Peter|title=Kurt Vonegut: Images and Representations|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=27675552|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] Vonnegut worked as a writer at the [[General Electric]] plant in [[Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  Ilium frequently appears in his writings, and is supposed to be the hometown of his character, [[Kilgore Trout]].

In 1980 the story was made into a short film with a running length of 25 minutes.  The film stars [[Dennis Dugan]] in the lead role with supporting roles played by [[Gordon Jump]], [[Bob Basso]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Bill Walker (actor)|Bill Walker]].  The film was directed by [[Ron Underwood]] and the screenplay adaptation was written by [[Brent Maddock]] and [[S. S. Wilson]].  The film was produced by [[Barr Films]].

==Plot==
David Potter, owner of a small town weekly [[newspaper]], decides to get a more secure job.  Despite his wife's misgivings, he applies to be a publicity writer at the mammoth [[Ilium (Kurt Vonnegut)|Ilium]] Works.  Although shaken at seeing how the company immediately plans out his entire career, he accepts the position.  He is then given his first assignment, recording the capture of a [[deer]] that has slipped onto the grounds of the Works.  After he and a [[photography|photographer]] finish their jobs the deer will be killed and served at a company dinner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book Rags&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Monkey House - Deer in the Works Summary &amp; Analysis|url=http://www.bookrags.com/studyguide-welcome-to-the-monkey-house/chapanal018.html#gsc.tab=0|publisher=Book Rags|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting hopelessly lost, Potter views the utter [[dehumanization]] of the workers.  Mistaken for a visiting scientist, he joins a party and has several drinks before finding a skirmish line of employees closing in on the deer.  He opens a gate, lets it escape, and then follows it out into the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grade Saver&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Kurt Vonnegut's Short Stories Summary and Analysis of &quot;Deer in the Works&quot;|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/kurt-vonnegut-short-stories/study-guide/summary-deer-in-the-works|publisher=Grade Saver|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Casco Viejo''' (Spanish for ''Old Quarter''), also known as '''Casco Antiguo''' or '''San Felipe''', is the historic district of [[Panama City]]. Completed and settled in 1673, it was built following the near-total destruction of the original Panamá city, [[Panamá Viejo]] in 1671, when the latter was attacked by pirates. It was designated a World Heritage Site in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Heritage&quot; /&gt;

==History==
Panama city was founded on August 15, 1519 and it lasted one hundred and fifty-two years. In January 1671, the Governor Juan Perez de Guzman had it set on fire, before the attack and looting by the pirate Henry Morgan. In 1672, Antonio Fernández de Córdoba initiated the construction of a new city, which was then founded on January 21, 1673. This city was built on a peninsula completely isolated by the sea and a defensive system of walls.&lt;ref name=CASTILLERO&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castillero|first1=Alfredo|title=UNESCO Guides: Panamá la Vieja and Casco Viejo|year=2004|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|isbn=92-3-103923-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this place preserves the first institutions and buildings of the modern city of Panama. It is known as ''Casco Viejo'' (Spanish for Old Town).

'''Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; William Angus''' (11 November 1889 – 23 March 1947) was a Scottish international [[rugby union]] and cricket player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/player/2024.html?class=1;template=results;type=player;view=match|title=Alexander Angus: International profile|accessdate=9 August 2012|publisher=Scrum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/25142.html |title=Alexander Angus |work=www.espncricinfo.com |publisher= |date= |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was capped eighteen for the {{nrut|Scotland}} rugby union team between 1909 and 1920.&lt;ref name=Bath1/&gt; He played club rugby for [[Watsonians RFC|Watsonians]].&lt;ref name=Bath1&gt;Bath, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Bath mentions him as one of the three Scottish players &quot;who've gone the longest without (between) scoring a try for Scotland&quot; along with [[Alan Tait]] and [[Gary Armstrong (rugby)|Gary Armstrong]].&lt;ref name=Bath2&gt;Bath, p64&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because [[World War I]] occurred in the middle of his international career, a period in which all international rugby ceased. He was first capped in 1909, scoring two tries in fourteen matches before the Great War.&lt;ref name=Bath2/&gt; His next four caps came in 1920, and he scored against {{nrut|Ireland}} on 28 February 1920 - just over nine years since his previous try.&lt;ref name=Bath2/&gt; Scotland won that match 19-0.&lt;ref name=Bath2/&gt;

He also played for the [[Scotland national cricket team]].&lt;ref name=Bath1/&gt;

'''Marco Rizo Ayala''' (November 30, 1920 – September 8, 1998) was a Cuban-born pianist, [[composer]], and [[arranger]]. He mastered the 19th Century works of composers [[Manuel Saumell]] and [[Ignacio Cervantes]].  He is best known for his role as [[pianist]], arranger and orchestrator for the American television [[sitcom]] ''[[I Love Lucy]]''  which aired from October 15, 1951 to May 6, 1957 on CBS, [[Columbia Broadcasting System]].

Throughout his career which combined the techniques of his classical training with [[Afro-Cuban]] and [[jazz]] rhythms, Rizo recorded nearly 30 albums.  He was born in [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], [[Cuba]].

==Early life==

Rizo’s father, Sebastian, a flutist with the Santiago [[Symphony Orchestra]], served as his son’s first musical instructor.  In 1932, Marco moved to [[Havana]] to attend the National [[Conservatory of Music]], where he studied under the tutelage of Spanish composer Pedro San Juan.  He remained there for six years, and in 1938 was named the official pianist of the Havana Philharmonic Orquestra, performing under the direction of [[Ernesto Lecuona]].  In 1939, he performed duo piano recitals with [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Rizo was considered Cuba's most important concert pianist by the age of 16. Rizo became interested in jazz through his work with his father's Rizo-Ayala Jazz Band.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/12/arts/marco-rizo-78-cuban-pianist-and-composer-for-i-love-lucy.html|title=Marco Rizi, 78, Cuban Pianist And Composer for 'I Love Lucy'|author=Watrous, Peter|publisher=New York Times|date=September 12, 1998|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, he migrated to the United States, having received a scholarship to the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in New York City.  There, he studied under [[Rosina Lhévinne]].  During [[World War II]], Rizo performed and worked with the 2nd Army Military Band.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

==Professional career==

At the end of the war, his childhood friend [[Desi Arnaz]] asked Rizo to join him as the pianist and orchestrator for his band, the [[Desi Arnaz|Desi Arnaz Orchestra]].  He toured the U.S. with the band until 1950.  When Arnaz started production of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', he once again turned to Rizo, hiring him to be the pianist and orchestrator for the show between 1951 and 1957.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;  Rizo also made several on-camera appearances on the show throughout its run on television.
Contrary to popular belief he did not write the I Love Lucy theme by himself which had music by Rizo, Eliot Daniel and Desi Arnaz  with lyrics by Harold Adamson.&lt;ref&gt;Entre Amigos Interview, {{cite web|title=http://www.youtube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NPEx6dNWQU|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics were only heard once on the series in the Season three episode 'Lucy's Last Birthday' made in 1953.
After the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' show ended, he remained with [[CBS]] and was the pianist-arranger for the “[[Bob Hope]] Radio Show.”

While in Los Angeles, he attended [[UCLA]] and studied under [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]].  Rizo composed motion picture music for Columbia, Paramount and [[MGM Studios]].  He continued his concert career in 1960, playing the music of Lecuona and other Cubans.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt;

In the early 1970s, Rizo worked as the musical director for the Royal Viking Sea cruise ship.  Throughout his career, he arranged for hundreds of top artists: [[Carmen Miranda]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Xavier Cugat]], [[Yma Sumac]], and [[Paquito D’Rivera]], among many others.  Some of his most memorable piano and orchestral compositions include “Suite Campesina,” “Ñañigo,” “Danzas Cubanas,” “Jose Marti-Sinfonia Cubana,” “Broadway Concerto,” “Suite of the Americas,” “Suite Española,” and “Visions of New York.”

==Legacy==

In the early 1980s, he founded the non-profit organization “The Marco Rizo Latin American Music Project” (SAMPI), which aimed to spread appreciation for [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and culture to students in universities, colleges, high schools, and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Entre Amigos Interview,  {{cite web|title=http://www.youtube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEcplL0FeHc|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Rizo won the Silver Medal of the French Academy of the Arts, Sciences and Letters.

He died of a heart attack in 1998 at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center.&lt;ref name=Obit/&gt; His sister, Vilma Rizo, donated many of his papers, files, and compositions to the Music Division at the [[New York Public Library]] for the Performing Arts located at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]].  Among the various items in the collection is an unpublished biography that Rizo wrote of his longtime friend Desi Arnaz entitled “The Desi I Knew” (1991).

Non notable actor. Has made very few appearances.

The '''Landmark Convention Center''' in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], Washington (Historically known as the '''Masonic Temple Building''', the '''Temple Theater''', '''Helig's Theater''', and '''John Hamrick's Temple Theater''') is located at 47 St. Helens Avenue. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1993. [[Ambrose J. Russell]] is credited as the architect of the meeting hall and theater. It is said to be in a [[Renaissance style]] and Late 19th And 20th Century Revival style, and said to have had its &quot;period of significance&quot; between 1925 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/WA/Pierce/state2.html #93000357] National Register of Historic Places&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the building served as a meeting hall for local area [[Masonic lodge]]s.  Today, no lodges meet in the building and it has been converted into a commercial catering and convention Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tacomaslandmark.com/ Landmark Catering and Convention Center website]&lt;/ref&gt; On Feb 5, 2018, the convention center ownership decided to not host a meeting organized by the Department of the Interior, canceling it with less than 24-hours notice due to &quot;concern for public safety.&quot;

==Ecology==
The large [[infructescence]]s of the plant dry up and may remain standing for a year or more, during which time they are inhabited by a variety of insect species and other arthropods. Several species of [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s, and [[bee]]s build nests in the dry fruiting structure. Surveys have revealed the nests of ants in the genera ''[[Camponotus]]'', ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'', and ''[[Solenopsis (ant)|Solenopsis]]'', and termites of the genera ''[[Cortaritermes]]'' and ''[[Velocitermes]]''. Other inhabitants of the plant include [[Castniidae|giant butterfly-moths]], [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[beetle]]s, [[pseudoscorpion]]s, [[springtail]]s, and [[spider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schmid, V. S., et al. (2014).

===Provincial/International career===
Smal had a limited international playing career due to the [[Culture of South Africa#International cultural boycott|international boycott]] of South African sports teams because of the [[apartheid]] regime which ended in 1992. He captained [[South African Gazelles]] (U24 side) in 1984. He turned out for the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] against the touring [[New Zealand Cavaliers]] in 1986, against a World Invitation XV in 1989 and a [[Serge Blanco]] World XV team against [[France national rugby union team|France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/283_12549.php|title=Gert Smal Joins Ireland Management Team|publisher=''Irishrugby.ie''|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2009-12-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also represented [[Western Province (rugby team)|Western Province]] between 1984 and 1993 and the South African Defence Forces in 1986 and 1987.

====Retirement from playing====
On the Australasian tour with Western Province in 1993, during a match against [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]], Smal received a blow in the mouth causing him to lose vision in the bottom corner of his left eye forcing his retirement from playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish Independent'&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/one-smal-step-for-ireland-1516247.html|title='One Smal step for Ireland'|date=2008-11-01|accessdate=2009-12-17|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
Following the end of his playing career, he was appointed to a number of key coaching positions in South Africa and held coaching positions at the [[Border Bulldogs]] (1998–99), [[Western Province (rugby team)|Western Province]] (2000–02) when they twice won the [[Currie Cup]] and then with the [[Stormers]] in the [[Super 12]] between 2003 and 2005, reaching the semi-finals in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish Independent'&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, Smal was appointed to the South African team management as assistant coach to [[Jake White]], during which time the Springboks won the Tri-Nations championship in 2004 before winning the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. When Jake White was replaced by  [[Peter de Villiers]] as head coach following the world cup in 2007, Smal offered to develop rugby in the [[Eastern Cape]] but was turned down by the [[South African Rugby Union]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Irish Independent'&quot;/&gt;

In June 2008, Smal was appointed forward coach to the Irish National team under [[Declan Kidney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/article-1027727/Ireland-snap-Springbok-coach-Smal.html|title=Ireland snap up Springbok coach Smal|author=Ben Rumsby|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Smal's time at Ireland, they won the [[2009 Six Nations Championship|2009 Six Nations]] completing the [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] for the first time [[1948 Five Nations Championship|in 61 years]].

In June 2011, he signed a contract extension with the IRFU.

Smal was forced to miss the remainder of the [[2012 Six Nations Championship]] after an eye condition struck him. His temporary replacement was [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] forwards coach [[Anthony Foley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/25708.php|title=Gert Smal Update|date=24 February 2012|work=irishrugby.ie|accessdate=24 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908114156/http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/25708.php|archivedate=8 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''411th Bombardment Group''' is an inactive [[United States Army Air Forces]] unit. Its last assignment was with [[III Bomber Command]] at [[Florence Army Air Field]], South Carolina, where it was inactivated on 1 May 1944.  In July 1985, the group was reconstituted as the '''411th Tactical Missile Wing''', but has never been active under that name.

==History==
The '''411th Bombardment Group''' was activated at [[Will Rogers Field]], Oklahoma on 1 August 1944.  Its original squadrons were the 648th, 649th, 650th and 651st Bombardment Squadrons.&lt;ref name=Maurer648BS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 694-695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer649BS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maurer651BS&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 695-696&lt;/ref&gt;  Two weeks later it moved to [[Florence Army Air Field]], South Carolina, where it absorbed the personnel of the [[65th Reconnaissance Group]], which had been training observation crews on [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] aircraft there.&lt;ref name=Maurer411BG&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was a [[World War II]] Replacement Training Unit, using [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] light bombers.  Replacement Training Units were oversized units that trained individual [[aircrew]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate, Vol. VI, introduction, p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating, the airmen were assigned to overseas combat units.&lt;ref name=Maurer411BG/&gt;

However, standard military units, based on relatively inflexible [[table of organization|tables of organization]] were proving poorly adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, the [[Army Air Forces]] adopted a more functional system in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.&lt;ref&gt;Goss, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was disbanded on 1 May 1944 and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 334th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Replacement Training Unit, Light Bombardment).&lt;ref name=Maurer411BG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/172/006.xml |title=Abstract, History Florence Army Air Field, Mar-May 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 1985 the group was reconstituted and redesignated the '''411th Tactical Missile Wing''', but was not activated.&lt;ref name=DAFMPM648q&gt;Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 648q, 31 July 1985, Subject: Reconstitution, Redesignation, and Consolidation of Selected Air Force Organizations&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fonissa''' ({{lang-el|Φόνισσα}}) is a stream in western [[Corinthia]], [[Peloponnese]], [[Greece]].  It is {{convert|13.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ypeka.gr/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=T4DDG1hqQMY%3D&amp;tabid=252&amp;language=el-GR Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment], Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and flows into the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. The source of the river is in the hills near the village [[Rethi]]. It flows towards the southeast though a narrow gorge, and empties into the Gulf of Corinth between the villages [[Kato Loutro]] and [[Kamari, Corinthia|Kamari]], 6&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Xylokastro]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amitai Regev''' (born December 7, 1940) is an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[mathematician]], known for his work in [[ring theory]].

He is the Herman P. Taubman Professor of Mathematics at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].  He received his doctorate from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1972, under the direction of [[Shimshon Amitsur]].

Regev has made significant contributions to the theory of [[polynomial identity ring]]s (PI rings).  In particular, he proved [[Regev's theorem]] that the [[tensor product]] of two PI rings is again a PI ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Israel Journal of Mathematics'' '''11''' (1972),   131-152&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed so-called &quot;Regev theory&quot; that connects PI rings to representations of the symmetric group, and hence to Young tableaux. He has made seminal contributions to the asymptotic enumeration of Young tableaux and tableaux of hook shape, and together with William  Beckner proved the [[Selberg integral|Macdonald-Selberg conjecture]] for the infinite [[Lie algebras]] of type ''B'', ''C'', and ''D''.

'''Rhodesleigh''', also known as the '''Rhodes Mansion''', is a historic residence in [[Lakewood, Washington]]. Architects involved in its design included [[Ambrose J. Russell]] and [[Frederick Heath (architect)|Frederick Heath]].

The house is located at 10815 Greendale Drive, built in 1922. The [[Rhodes Brothers]] were involved in the retail trade and had Rhodes department stores in Tacoma and other areas. The business was established in 1892 as a coffee shop in downtown Tacoma by Albert, William, Henry, and Charles Rhodes.

The {{convert|12600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} 1921 house with its 8+ bedrooms and 7+ bathrooms was on sale in 2009 for $3.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;for sale&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesleigh.com|title=Real Estate For Sale in Lakewood WA, Michael Morrison MyUniqueHome.com|accessdate=2010-02-20|work=rhodesleigh.com|last=Morrison|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its carriage house (built later in 1941) at 10914 Greendale was also up for sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;carriage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodesleigh.com|title=10914 Greendale Dr SW, Lakewood, WA 98498|accessdate=2010-02-20|work=redfin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on [[Lake Steilacoom]]. According to the broker's website it was built in memory of Edward Rhodes &quot;who served and paid the ultimate sacrifice in World War I&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;for sale&quot;/&gt;

It was founded and led by a man who goes by the assumed name, [[Makoto Sakurai (Japanese writer)|Makoto Sakurai]]. On November 16, 2014, Yasuhiro Yagi was selected as chairman for the fifth term as the result of a vote of confidence by the group's members. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zaitokukai.info/modules/news/article.php?storyid=639 (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
Zaitokukai was founded on December 2, 2006, and held its inaugural meeting in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Makoto Sakurai, ''Daikenkanjidai'' (大嫌韓時代), Seirindo, 2014, p. 162. &lt;/ref&gt;

Sakurai founded Zaitokukai after seeing a TV news report about a group of Japanese citizens was organized to support Zainichi Koreans who brought a lawsuit to obtain national pensions without making any premium payments. Sakurai was disturbed by the fact that there were Japanese who backed a suit which he thought could destroy the Japanese pension system. He then searched for a conservative political organization fighting against what he regarded as an extraordinary demand of Zainichi Koreans, but could find none. He then decided to establish Zaitokukai.&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, pp. 159–160. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Activities===
The group has been protesting against the extension of [[suffrage]] to foreign nationals. In September 2009, it held a demonstration in [[Akihabara]] calling for the resistance to granting suffrage to foreign nationals with about 1,000 participants, according to Sakurai himself.&lt;ref&gt;Makoto Sakurai, ''Zaitokukai toha “Zainichi Tokken o Yurusanai Shimin no Kai no Ryakusho desu!'' (在特会とは「在日特権を許さない市民の会」の略称です！) meaning “Zaitokukai is short for ‘Association of Citizens against the Special Privileges of the Zainichi!’”, Seirindo, 2013, p. 62. &lt;/ref&gt; Some time before that, Zaitokukai held a counter-protest against a demonstration by more than 3,000 in [[Ginza, Tokyo]], organized by [[Mindan]] (the Korean Residents Union in Japan) to extend suffrage to foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Ditto, p. 63. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The group involves themselves extensively on [[social media]].&lt;ref name=Vice/&gt;

Several members of the group made donations to the political funding organization of [[Tomomi Inada]] between 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170602/p2a/00m/0na/007000c Supreme Court dismisses LDP's Inada's defamation suit against the Mainichi], ''The Mainichi'' (June 2 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agenda==
Zaitokukai alleges that Zainichi Koreans have special legal rights granted to them through the process of their integration into the Japanese society. It claims that members of this ethnic group use &quot;pass names&quot; that are Japanese-style and often very different from their original Korean names to abuse welfare and administrative systems. Members of the group also believe that it is much easier for Zainichi Koreans to claim and receive welfare benefits than it is for Japanese citizens, causing serious problems in the entire welfare system in Japan to the detriment of Japanese citizens. It accuses Zainichi Koreans of cheating the tax system as well, claiming that Zainichi Koreans pay reduced amounts for many taxes, including income tax, corporate tax, and council tax. It argues that Zainichi Koreans wrongfully claim those rights by saying that they are a deprived and discriminated minority in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zaitokukai.info/modules/about/zai/promises.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of its goals, Zaitokukai has set an ultimate goal of repealing the {{nihongo|Special Act on Immigration Control|入管特例法}} &lt;ref&gt;Formally “Special Act on the Immigration Control of, Inter Alia, Those Who Have Lost Japanese Nationality Pursuant to the Treaty of Peace with Japan” ([http://law.e-gov.go.jp/htmldata/H03/H03HO071.html 日本国との平和条約に基づき日本の国籍を離脱した者等の出入国管理に関する特例法]) (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; which gives Zainichi Koreans [[Special Permanent Resident (Japan)|special permanent residence]] status which can never be granted to other foreign nationals. The first chairman Sakurai declared in his book that Zaitokukai would be dissolved when the Special Act on Immigration Control is repealed.&lt;ref&gt;Makoto Sakurai, ''Zaitokukai toha &quot;Zainichi Tokken o Yurusanai Shimin no Kai&quot; no Ryakusho desu!'' (在特会とは「在日特権を許さない市民の会」の略称です！) (which means ″Zaitokukai is short for ′Association of Citizens against the Special Privileges of the Zainichi!′″), Seirindo, 2013, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The second chairman, Yasuhiro Yagi, also affirmed in his inauguration message that Zaitokukai’s ultimate objective is to annul the said Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaitokukai.info/modules/news/article.php?storyid=640 会長選挙当選の挨拶] (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[File:Ultra-left activists protest against anti-Korean rally on 31 March 2013 at Shin-Okubo 02.JPG|thumb|right|Anti-Zaitokukai rally in Tokyo, 2013]]
The group is criticized for its aggressive and racist behaviour towards non-citizen residents of Japan, mostly Zainichi Koreans. Its supporters have described Zainichi Koreans as &quot;criminals&quot; and &quot;cockroaches&quot;, and called upon them to be killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCurry1&quot; /&gt;

It frequently organizes small-scale public demonstrations against Zainichi Koreans and other social and political issues, and its members make racist insults against Koreans, Chinese, and other foreign nationals in these demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/asia-pacific/a-black-sun-rises-in-a-declining-japan/article1744434/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=A black sun rises in a declining Japan | date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for ''Vice News'' pointed out they tend to focus on Zainichi Koreans to the exclusion of other groups that might violate immigration statutes.&lt;ref name=Vice/&gt;

They also take to the Internet, and in August 2014, Lee Sin (variously named as Lee Shinhae and Lee Shin-hye), a Zainichi Korean freelance writer, filed two lawsuits, one for damages of ¥5.5 million against the group and Sakurai and ¥22 million against the administrator of Hoshu Shimpo, a conservative news website compiler for [[defamation]] by hate speech, the first of its kind. Ms. Lee received sometimes hundreds of negative messages daily on her social networking site and says that she would like to hold responsible website compiler that profits from compiling discriminatory internet commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Mei, &quot;Damages Claimed for Hate Speech&quot;, Voices From Japan (Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center), No. 29 March 2015, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikuo Gonoi, a professor at [[Takachiho University]] and researcher at the Institute of Social Science at [[International Christian University]], described them in 2013 as &quot;just an archaic type of 'mob' (which [[Hannah Arendt]] defined in ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', 1951), not something like a 'new wave{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astand.asahi.com/magazine/wrpolitics/2013060400011.html &quot;Spreading hate speech: from revisionism to anti-semitism&quot;], June 5, 2013, ''[[Asahi Shimbun|Astand]]'' {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

In 2009 they showed up at the school and home of a Filipino girl whose parents were deported for overstaying their visas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/fukushima-gave-rise-anti-racism-movement-170310103716807.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they protested showings of ''[[The Cove (film)|The Cove]].''&lt;ref name=NYT10&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/world/asia/29japan.html?ref=world&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2009, four members of Zaitokukai were arrested for harassing Korean students in [[Minami-ku, Kyoto|Minami Ward]], [[Kyoto]],&lt;ref name=&quot;harassment of schoolchildren&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On 17 June 2013, Makoto Sakurai and three other members were arrested in [[Shinjuku]], Tokyo, when a fistfight broke between counter-protesters and the Zaitokukai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/world/asia/8-arrested-in-tokyo-fights-involving-anti-korean-group.html | work=The New York Times | first=Martin | last=Fackler | title=8 Arrested in Tokyo Fights Involving Anti-Korean Group | date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, their demonstration of 100 in [[Ikebukuro]] were met by double the number of counterprotesters. Sakurai's van was surrounded but managed to escape to Koreatown, and one member and four counterprotesters were arrested.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/world/asia/29japan.html?ref=world&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Gnaeus Manlius Vulso''' was [[Roman consul]] in 474 BC with [[Lucius Furius Medullinus (consul 474 BC)|Lucius Furius Medullinus Fusus]].

The historian [[Livy]] calls him ''Gaius''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.54&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern writers refer to him as ''Aulus'', assuming that he is the same person as the [[decemviri|decemvir]] of 451 BC, who is called ''Aulus'' in the ''[[Fasti Capitolini]]''.  However, the chronology of this family makes this extremely improbable, leading to the conclusion that he was in fact ''Gnaeus'', the father of the decemvir. The ''[[praenomina]] [[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]'' were often confused in early records, which would account for the appearance of that name in Livy's history.

== Life ==
His father's name was Gaius (or Gnaeus), and his grandfather's Publius.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fasti Capitolini]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William, ed. (1870). &quot;Vulso&quot;. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. 3. p. 1285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Thomas Robert Shannon; Patterson, Marcia L. (Collaborator). The Magistrates of the Roman Republic. Philological Monograph No. 15. American Philological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his consulship, Manlius was assigned the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars#Veii-Sabine alliance 475-474 BC|war against Veii]].  The Veientes sued for peace, which the Romans accepted.  Upon the Veientes giving tribute of corn and money for the Roman troops, a truce of forty years was agreed.  As a consequence Manlius gained the honour of an [[ovation]] on his return to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.54&lt;/ref&gt; which he celebrated on 15 March 474 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fasti Triumphales]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, Manlius and his colleague were brought to trial by the [[tribune]] Gnaeus Genucius for failing to appoint the [[Decemviri#Decemviri Agris Dandis Adsignandis|decemvirs]] to allocate the public lands. However, on the day of the trial Genucius was found dead, and as a consequence the charges were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Romaike Archaiologia'', ix. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe condita (book)|Ab Urbe condita]]'', ii.54&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Romance of Chastisement''''' is a Victorian [[pornographic]] collection on the theme of [[flagellation]] by St George Stock (a probable [[pseudonym]], also credited with ''[[The Whippingham Papers]]'') and published by [[John Camden Hotten]] in 1866.  It was reprinted by [[William Lazenby]] in 1883 and again by [[Charles Carrington]] in 1902 as ''The Magnetism of the Rod or the Revelations of Miss Darcy''.

==Background==
Elena graduated from the Voronezh State Technical University with a master's degree in Public Relations. She began training to lose weight in 1998. Generally it was step aerobics at that time. Elena decided to become a bodybuilder after attending a local bodybuilding contest where she got a very good impression of the competitors. She was also inspired by the magazines with well-known female bodybuilders as [[Lenda Murray]], [[Cory Everson]] and [[Juliette Bergmann]] on their covers. In 2004 Elena changed her career and became a personal trainer. In winter 2006 Elena moved to [[Moscow]] and worked there at one of the leading fitness center.[http://www.getfit.ru/clubs/news/news_1823.html]. In 2009 Elena moves to [[Miami]] ([[Florida]], [[US]]) and lives there up to the present moment. Married, no children.

==Bodybuilding career==
In 2003 Elena competed in her first contest FBFR Southern Russia Third Championship &quot;Samson 22&quot;, finishing in sixth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= samson-gym.ru| url=
http://www.samson-gym.ru/sams22.html | title= Samson 22 Protocol | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004 Panova suffered a car crash injury and was not able to train and compete for a year. In 2005, she took second place at the WFF-WBBF Russia Amateur Championship. In 2006 Elena earned her professional status at WFF-WBBF Europe Pro Championship, finishing in fourth place. Her greatest success as a professional has been the second place at the WFF-WBBF World Pro Championship 2007 and 2008.

'''''Pellaea calidirupium''''' (''Hot rock fern'') is a plant, of eastern [[Australia]] restricted to rock crevices in relatively arid environments. It is found in [[Tasmania]] where it is considered rare and is only found on the East Coast, the Midlands and lower slopes of the Centtral Plateau on dry rock faces. It is also found in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]]. The species was originally described from [[New Zealand]], where it has a disjunct distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Brownsey, P.J.; Lovis, J.D. 1990: ''Pellaea calidirupium'' - a new fern species from New Zealand. ''New Zealand journal of botany'', '''28'''(3): 197-205. {{doi|10.1080/0028825X.1990.10412308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fronds may be up to  50&amp;nbsp;cm long, and are sexually dimorphic with shorter sterile fronds with up to 12 pinnae. The stipe can occupy nearly half the length of the frond .  Reddish brown   scales and hairs cover both the stipe and rachis. The spore bearing rachis may have up to 40 pinnae eavh borne on a short stalk . The leaves are glossy green with characteristic in-rolled sori as a band around the paler green underside of each pinna.  The terminal pinnae is sometimes greatly enlarged.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''James Princip Beadle''' (1863–1947), was an [[English people|English]] painter of historical and military scenes. Born in [[Calcutta]] on 22 September 1863, his father was [[Major-General]] James Pattle Beadle. For three years, he studied with [[Legros]] at the [[Slade School]] in London and at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]] in Paris under [[Alexandre Cabanel]]; his final studies were back in London with [[G.F. Watts]].

==Painting career==

Beadle first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1884 and also at the Paris Salon. Five years later, he was awarded a bronze medals at the Paris [[World's fair|Exposition Universelle]]. Growing up in a military family, the artist was particularly attracted to military subjects and one of his earliest pieces depicted the inspection of the [[Duke of Yorks Own Loyal Suffolk Hussars]] at Bury St. Edmonds in 1893. From then on, he was a frequent exhibitor of 'battle' paintings at the RA, the New Gallery and elsewhere. In a review published in the [[Illustrated London News]] on 19 May 1894, Beadle's military pieces were singled-out for praise: &quot;He does not go out of his way to flatter 'Tommy Atkins', but he shows him to the public under many forms and in many becoming uniforms. He has studied him at home and abroad, at peace and at war, on horseback and on foot...&quot;

While many of his scenes represented contemporary events such as the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Boer War]] and the [[First World War]], Beadle found the subject of the [[Peninsular War]], particularly interesting and visited Spain and Portugal in 1912 to sketch the battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;A number of his pencil sketches drawn during this trip are reproduced in Willoughby Verner's 'History and Campaigns of the Rifle Brigade'.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1924, the artist was still paintings scenes from the [[Peninsular War]], but the events of 1914-1918 were also occupying his mind, and several notable paintings were produced including ''Neuve Chapelle, 10 March 1915'', ''Dawn: Waiting to go over'', and ''Breaking the Hindenburg Line''. In his final years, he lived in [[Kensington]] and died at his home on Eldon Road on 13 August 1947, leaving his widow, A.M.G. Beadle.

I've listed this article for peer review because I've considerably expanded the article and would like to receive suggestions on how to improve this article up to GA standards.  

Thanks, [[User:Vaughanchris|Vaughanchris]] ([[User talk:Vaughanchris|talk]]) 21:18, 16 December 2009 (UTC)

'''Comments by doncram''' First, it seems to me that the article should be moved to &quot;School for Creative and Performing Arts (Cincinnati, Ohio)&quot;, to add the disambiguating and clarifying parenthetical phrase.  Google search turns up similarly named schools in San Diego and Pittsburgh;  the San Diego one uses &quot;of&quot; rather than &quot;for&quot;.  The current title &quot;School for Creative and Performing Arts&quot; seems like a non-unique name, and it seems possibly a tad Ohio-centric to assert, implicitly, that the use of the preposition &quot;for&quot; is to be understood by the world to mean the Cincinnati school.  I notice also that [[School of Creative and Performing Arts]] is currently a redirect to this page;  it could/should be made into a disambiguation page listing all instead.  Or, is this SCPA that famous, nation- or world-wide, that it is really an obvious primary use for the phrase? 

Second, the article seems perhaps more detailed than necessary, and perhaps more promotional in tone.  For example, that &quot;The college-preparatory curriculum includes language arts, foreign language, mathematics, science, and social studies&quot; seems unsurprising and not different than what most high U.S. high schools cover.  That &quot;Advanced Placement courses are available in many of these subjects. The school serves students will all academic needs, including those with special needs.&quot; seems to be relevant for a school brochure for prospective students and their parents, but not necessary for a wikipedia article. 

I notice one sentence needing clarification:  &quot;SCPA has historically been among the highest-scoring public schools, second only to Walnut Hills High School, the selective public college preparatory magnet.[5]&quot;  Among the highest-scoring out of what set, schools in Ohio, the nation, the world?

:Addendum:  Actually maybe the school is that famous, and should stay at the current article title.  I am just not familiar with it.  Also, i did start a disambiguation page at [[School of Creative and Performing Arts]].

:I wonder about another claim, that this is &quot;the first and only school to combine a full range of arts studies with a rigorous academic program for elementary through high school&quot;.  The only school in the world?  I am sure that depends on how you define &quot;a full range&quot; and &quot;rigorous&quot;.  I'd be more comfortable if a broad claim like that was presented as a quotation from a source.  If it's the school's own assertion, it can still be given, but it should be identified clearly as being their own claim.

::Further about the disambiguation issues, i developed the disambiguation page further and just found [[School for the Creative and Performing Arts]] about a Kentucky school, whose wikipedia article started in 2006.  I note a discussion section at the Cleveland school's talk page on the issue, previously, too.  I'll open a requested move about renaming both of these two school wikipedia pages, to address that.  About other matters in this article, perhaps someone else will give more comments.  I may not comment further myself, esp. in the absence of some response about my comments so far though.

:Thank you for your review and comments. I've made additional edits per your suggestions, and I agree they improve the article. Regarding the renaming question, I think it is a valid discussion and I have commented on the talk page.

The '''Pfitzner Flyer''' was an innovative [[monoplane]] designed in 1909 by [[Alexander Pfitzner]] and built by the [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] company at [[Hammondsport]], [[New York (state)|NY]], where Pfitzner was employed at the time.

The Flyer was the first [[monoplane]] designed, built and flown in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=NYT_19100116/&gt;  It incorporated several novel features, the most innovative of which was the method of achieving lateral control by means of reciprocating lateral ([[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]]) wing extensions, which the pilot controlled via a steering wheel. Also unusual for a monoplane was the use of a [[pusher configuration]], the engine also being mounted behind the pilot.&lt;ref name=Loening_p134/&gt;

The aircraft was not a success, and a disappointed Pfitzner is thought to have committed suicide on 12 July 1910.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(30)&gt;''Flight'' Magazine II (30), p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Villard&gt;Villard (2002), p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since their success with the first recorded powered flight, the [[Wright Brothers]] had patented many of their methods and had sought to enforce their patents through the courts.&lt;ref name=Ashby&gt;Ashby (2002), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Most if not all other manufacturers were keen to develop alternative techniques; Pfitzner avoided the Wrights' method of [[Wing warping|warping]] the wings to achieve a lift differential between port and starboard wings by using wing extensions (or 'compensators'), described below. In his book “Monoplanes and Biplanes: Their Design, Construction and Operation” (1911), [[Grover Loening]] wrote “This aeroplane is a distinct departure from all other monoplanes in the placing of the motor, aviator, and rudders, and in the comparatively simple and efficient method of transverse control by sliding surfaces, applied here for the first time.”.&lt;ref name=Loening_p134&gt;Loening (1911), p.134.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of patent protection was sufficiently in the public eye for ''[[The New York Times]]'', in its issue of 16 January 1910, to headline Pfitzner’s design as an “Aeroplane Without Patent Drawbacks&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT_19100116/&gt; The same article refers to the “Wright suits” and their attempts to “build up their patent fences”; Pfitzner is quoted there as saying that “any one who wants to do so is welcome to use &lt;nowiki&gt;[his]&lt;/nowiki&gt; panel invention without cost or fear of injunction”.&lt;ref name=NYT_19100116&gt;''New York Times'' ([https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/01/16/105073520.pdf NYT 16 Jan. 1910])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
Pfitzner, a “designer of high-class gasoline motors, transmissions, and gears” &lt;ref name=NYT_19100116/&gt; was employed by Glen Curtiss at his Hammondsport factory. Pfitzner designed his ''Flyer'' as a private project but it was constructed in the Curtiss factory.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)/&gt;

The aircraft consisted of a [[Cuboid#Rectangular cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] [[Cross bracing|cross-braced]] central frame, onto which the main monoplane wing, the motor, the forward and rear booms and the ‘undercarriage’ (consisting of one wheel at each of the lower corners) were mounted. Between the upper front and rear posts of the frame were fitted two streamlined fuel tanks (clearly visible in the image above), one on each side of and above the pilot’s seat, with a combined capacity of six gallons (22.7 L.).&lt;ref name=Flight_II(9)/&gt;

[[File:PfitznerFlyer Control linkage FlightGlobalVoll II(9) p.182.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Diagram showing aircraft control linkages between control column and various control surfaces|Image first published in ''Flight'' Vol. II(11) in 1910, from Flight Global archive]]

The pilot sat immediately forward of the wing and controlled the aircraft by a combination a movable column and a wheel mounted on that column. Pitch was controlled by fore and aft movement of the column, which, by means of wires, moved the elevator mounted at the forward end of the front boom. Yaw control was effected by twisting the column about its vertical axis (by means of pressure on the steering wheel), which turned the vertical rudder (mounted above the elevator) left or right. Lateral control was achieved by rotating the wheel: When the pilot turned the steering-wheel to port, the linkage (shown below and here&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)&gt;''Flight'' II (11), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;) retracted the port wingtip, at the same time extending the starboard extension by the same amount. Thus there was no need for a rudder bar (or pedals); the pilot’s feet were not used for controlling the aircraft. Also mounted on the control column was a throttle lever; a button on the wheel enabled &quot;the Bosch high-tension magneto to be switched off for the purpose of switching off the engine&quot;. There was a fixed tail-plane surface with an area of 10.5 sq.ft. (0.98 sq.m.) at the end of the rear boom to provide  longitudinal stability.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)/&gt;
[[File:PfitznerFlyer Front view of wing trussing Flight Vol.II(11) FlightGlobal archive.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of early aircraft from the front showing king posts and trusses supporting the wings|Image first published in ''Flight'' Vol. II(11) in 1910, from Flight Global archive]]

The span of the main wing, which was set at an angle for incidence of 8°, was 31&amp;nbsp;ft., with a wingtip extension of {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on}} on each wing, providing a constant wingspan of 33&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. (10.21 m). The wing was 6&amp;nbsp;ft. (1.8 m) wide; the extensible wingtips were 4&amp;nbsp;ft. 2 in. (1,27 m) wide, each providing a maximum of 10.5 sq. ft. (0.98 sq.m.) wing area. The wing extensions were of the same curvature as the main wing.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)/&gt; “The main supporting plane at a 5-deg. dihedral angle consists of two main beams across which are placed spruce ribs. The surface is made of Baldwin vulcanized silk, of jet black color, tacked to the top of the ribs and laced to the frame. The curvature of the surface is slight and is designed for high speed.” &lt;ref name=Loening_p134/&gt;  The wing ribs had a camber of 3.75 in. (9.05&amp;nbsp;cm) over 6&amp;nbsp;ft (1.8 m).&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)/&gt;

Each of the wings consists of three detachable sections, each 5&amp;nbsp;ft. (1.5 m.) long, which are supported by steel sockets and steel cable, the latter forming a symmetrical double king truss with the beams, fore and aft pairs of [[King post]]s being situated at the junctions of the sections.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(11)/&gt;

==Operational history==
Pfitzner himself, although an inexperienced flyer at the time,&lt;ref name=Loening_p134/&gt; conducted initial test flights with his ''Flyer'', the first taking place in early January 1910.  Despite the presence of a light covering of snow at the time, it was reported that the ''Flyer'' had made a large number of short flights and that it required an average run of 100&amp;nbsp;ft. (30 m) to get airborne.&lt;ref name=Flight_II(9)&gt;''Flight'' II (9), p.142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Pfitzner’s disappearance (and assumed suicide) in July, 1910, Horace K. Kearney took over the aircraft and demonstrated it at [[Fly-in|aero meets]] in the succeeding months, including in [[Boston]], before the ''Pfitzner Flyer'' became little more than an interesting footnote in the history of aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;thecrimson&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1910/9/27/aeronautical-society-meet-pone-of-the/|title = AERONAUTICAL SOCIETY MEET At Field in Squantum, September 3–13|accessdate = 2009-12-16|last = The Harvard Crimson|authorlink = |date=September 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars|Gliese]] 1214''' is a dim [[Stellar classification#Class M|M4.5]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rojas-Ayala2010&quot;/&gt; [[red dwarf]] in the constellation [[Ophiuchus]] with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 14.7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berta2011&quot;/&gt; It is located at a distance of approximately 47 light years from [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglada-Escudé2012&quot;/&gt; The star is about one-fifth the radius of the [[Sun]]&lt;ref name=&quot;harvardpress&quot;/&gt; with a surface temperature estimated to be {{convert|3000|K|comma=gaps}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvardpress&quot;/&gt; Its luminosity is only 0.003% that of the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvardpress&quot;/&gt;

The estimate for the stellar radius is 15% larger than predicted by theoretical models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charbonneau2009&quot;/&gt; It also shows a 1% intrinsic variability in the near-infrared probably caused by [[Starspot|stellar spots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berta2011&quot;/&gt; The star is rotating slowly, with a period that is most likely an integer multiple of 53&amp;nbsp;days. It is probably at least three billion years old and a member of the old disk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berta2011&quot;/&gt; Although GJ 1214 has a low to moderate level of [[magnetic activity]], it does undergo [[stellar flare|flares]] and is a source of [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray emission]] with a base luminosity of {{Val|7.4e25|u=erg s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The temperature of the [[corona]] is estimated to be about {{Val|3.5e6|u=K}}.&lt;ref name=Lalitha2014/&gt;

==Planetary system==

In mid-December 2009, a team of Harvard-Smithsonian astronomers announced the discovery of a companion [[extrasolar planet]], [[Gliese 1214 b]], potentially composed largely of water and having the mass and diameter of a [[super-Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Charbonneau2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harvardpress&quot;/&gt;

Discovered by the [[MEarth Project|MEarth project]] and investigated further by the HARPS spectrograph on [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]’s 3.6-metre telescope at [[La Silla]], GJ 1214 b is the second super-Earth [[exoplanet]] for which astronomers have determined the mass and radius, giving vital clues about its structure. It is also the first super-Earth around which an atmosphere has been found. A search for additional planets using [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit timing variation method (TTV) and transit duration variation method (TDV)|transit timing variations]] was negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berta2011&quot;/&gt;

No transit-time variations have yet been found for this transit. As of 2012, &quot;the given data does not allow us to conclude that there is a [second] planet in the mass range 0.1–5 Earth-masses and the period range 0.76–1.23 or 1.91–3.18 days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harpsøe&quot;/&gt; The X-ray flux from the host star is estimated to have stripped {{earth mass|2−5.6}} from the planet over the lifetime of the system.&lt;ref name=Lalitha2014/&gt;

'''''Concrete Jungle''''' is a 2009 debut album by Scorcher released independently. The album is seen as a critical success in [[electronic music]], but a major disappointment to [[Grime (music)|grime]] fans. The albums has spawned two singles, 'I Know' and 'Lipsin' Ting', neither of which charted. The albums has been widely anticipated by many in the grime scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrecordshop.com/item/scorcher-concrete-jungle.html |title=Scorcher - Concrete Jungle |publisher=Ukrecordshop.com |date=2009-11-23 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but disappointed many in the scene. It features collaborations with the likes of Wiley, J2K, and Wretch 32. The album was inspired by a short freestyle by Scorcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwdmag.com/music/grime-garage-bassline-and-dubstep/audio/scorcher-concrete-jungle |title=Music &amp;#124; RWD |publisher=Rwdmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd single from the album is 'Dark Knight'.

The '''Hirth F-23''' is a twin cylinder, [[horizontally-opposed]], [[two stroke]], [[carburetor|carburetted]] or optionally [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] aircraft engine designed for use on [[ultralight aircraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliche&quot;&gt;Cliche, Andre: ''Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide'' 8th Edition, page G-3 Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-9680628-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F23&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.recpower.com/F-23%202%20cycle%2050hp.htm|title = F-23 2 cycle 50hp |accessdate = 17 January 2013|last = Recreational Power  Engineering |authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerocrafter&quot;&gt;Purdy, Don: ''AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook'', page 72. BAI Communications. {{ISBN|0-9636409-4-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The F-23 is intended to compete with the {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 503]] and is differentiated from the [[Rotax]] powerplant by offering a horizontally-opposed cylinder layout. The F-23 uses free air cooling and piston-ported induction, with dual Bing 34mm slide or optional diaphragm type carburetors. The cylinder walls are electrochemically coated with [[Nikasil]]. Standard starting is [[recoil start]]. A belt reduction drive system, [[fuel injection]], tuned exhaust and electric start are optional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliche&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F23&quot; /&gt;

The engine runs on a 50:1 pre-mix of [[Avgas#Automotive gasoline|unleaded 93 octane auto fuel]] and oil. Recommended time between overhauls is 1000 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliche&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F23&quot; /&gt;

The F-23 produces {{convert|50|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6150 rpm and {{convert|40|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cliche&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F23&quot; /&gt;

'''Lisa Farnell''' (born September 23, 1986 in [[Toronto]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-[[England|English]] [[curling|curler]] originally from [[Peterborough, Ontario]]. She was the skip of the Ontario team at the 2006 [[Canadian Junior Curling Championships]].

In 2006, Farnell and her team of [[Kim Brown (curler)|Kim Brown]], [[Darrelle Johnson]] and [[Amber Gebhardt]] won the provincial junior championships, earning the right to represent Ontario at the [[2006 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]] in [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]]. At the Canadian Juniors, the team finished with a 5-6 record, tied for sixth place.

Farnell would later team up with 2005 provincial champion skip [[Erin Morrissey]] to form a competitive team on the women's [[World Curling Tour]]. The team made it to their first [[2010 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts|provincial women's championship in 2010]], where they finished with a 5-4 record before losing in a tie-breaker match.

Farnell won her first [[World Curling Tour]] event at the [[2013 Challenge Chateau Cartier de Gatineau]]. Her win involved defeating defending Canadian champion [[Rachel Homan]] in the semi-final and her third ([[Erin Morrissey]])'s sister, [[Katie Morrissey]] in the final.

Farnell moved to [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fentonsrink.co.uk/Offers-and-News&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]] and will represent England at the [[2017 European Curling Championships]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Xunyang River''' ({{zh|c=浔阳江|p=Xúnyáng Jiāng}}) is a section of [[Yangtze River]] north of [[Jiujiang]], [[Jiangxi]] province, [[China]].

Jiujiang had ancient names like Chaisang ({{zh|c=柴桑|p=Chái Sāng}}) and Xunyang ({{zh|c=浔阳|p=Xúnyáng}}), thus the section of Yangtze River passing Jiujiang was thus named. Today, there is one [[Xunyang District]] in Jiujiang.

{{Campaignbox Leningrad and Baltics 1941–1944}}
The '''Oranienbaum Bridgehead''' (Ораниенбаумский плацдарм in Russian) was an isolated portion of the [[Leningrad Oblast]] in Russia, which was retained under  Soviet control during the [[siege of Leningrad]] in World War II. It played a significant role in protecting the city.

==History==

The area is located near the [[Lomonosov, Russia|town of Lomonosov]] (formerly Oranienbaum) and centred on the [[Krasnaya Gorka fort|Krasnaya Gorka Fort complex]]. The Germans approached Leningrad in early September 1941 and reached the Gulf of Finland on the 7th, isolating an area 65&amp;nbsp;km long and up to 25&amp;nbsp;km deep along the Baltic Coast. This area was heavily fortified and defended by the soldiers of the Red Army and Sailors of the Baltic Fleet. An attempt to link up with the main soviet forces around Leningrad, the Strelna Peterhof operation was mounted on 5–10 October but failed.

On 2 November 1941, the [[19th Rifle Corps]] was reorganised as the 2nd Neva Operations Group, then quickly the Coastal Operations Group, of the [[Leningrad Front]] to defend the pocket. It initially included the [[48th Rifle Division|48th]] and the 2nd and 5th Naval Rifle Brigades, under the former commander of the 19th Rifle Corps, General Antonov. 

Later the garrison included the 48th Rifle Division, the [[98th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|98th]] and [[168th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|168th Rifle Divisions]] as well as parts of the [[Baltic Fleet]] which provided gunfire support and supply. The commander between 1942 and 1943 was General Vladimir Romanovsky. He was replaced by [[Ivan Fedyuninsky]] in December 1943. In November 1943, the [[2nd Shock Army]] was sent into the bridgehead. On 14 January 1944, the 2nd Shock Army attacked out of the bridgehead during the [[Krasnoye Selo–Ropsha Offensive]]. Part of the [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive]], it helped break the Siege of Leningrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stalin's War with Germany: The road to Berlin|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6UaU6ZLqK4UC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 0300078137|language = en|first = John|last = Erickson|pages = 167-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several monuments from the [[Green Belt of Glory]] are located within the former bridgehead

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Via Heraclea''', ('''Heraclea''' or '''Heraklea'''), '''Heraklean Way''' ({{lang-el|Ηράκλεια οδός}}) was an important historic road that ran along the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from at least the sixth century BC. Much of its design is the direct ancestor of the Roman [[Via Augusta]]. It was used mainly for the trade between the Greek colonies of the Spanish Levante and the territories of [[Turdetania]] ([[Hispania Baetica]], [[Andalusia]]).

==Route==
[[Image:Iberian Peninsula in 125-en.svg|thumb|right|The Iberian peninsula in 125 CE, showing the ''Via Augusta'' by its other name, ''Via Herculea'']]
The route started in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] Iberian ports of [[Akra Leuke]] ([[Alicante]]), [[Alonis]] ([[Villajoyosa]]) and [[Hēmeroskopeion]] ([[Denia]]). It passed through the modern province of [[Albacete]] to [[Sierra Morena]] and into the territory of [[Turdetania]] ([[Tartessos]]), [[Hispania Baetica]] which approximates with modern [[Andalusia]]. South of the current city of [[Ciudad Real]] and Albacete, it formed a trading link to the mines of the [[Guadalquivir]] and [[Guadiana]]. The route from Sierra Morena went to [[Oretana]], entering the capital [[Castulo]] (near present [[Linares, Jaén|Linares]]), or from the east by the city of [[Obulco]] (now [[Porcuna]]). The route continued south reaching [[Kart-Iuba]] ([[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]) and [[Spalis]] ([[Seville]]).

'''Synthalin''' was an oral [[anti-diabetic drug]]. Discovered in 1926 it was marketed in Europe by [[Schering AG]] of Berlin as a synthetic drug with [[insulin]]-like properties that could be taken orally. However, it was toxic to the liver and kidney and was withdrawn from the market in the early 1940s.

==History==
The folk remedy [[Galega officinalis|French lilac]] (''Galega officinalis''), was used to treat the symptoms of [[diabetes]], and towards the end of the nineteenth century it was discovered to contain [[guanidine]]. This had an [[hypoglycaemic]] effect but was very toxic to the liver. [[Karl Slotta]] at the Chemistry Institute of the [[University of Vienna]] synthesied derived compounds that had a [[polymethylene]] chain with a guanidine group at each end. These diguanides were less toxic and more potent than guanidine. In 1926, E. Frank, working in [[Oskar Minkowski]]'s clinic in [[University of Wroclaw|Wroclaw]] performed a clinical trial on one of these agents. It was subsequently marketed as Synthalin by Schering AG for treating mild cases of diabetes.

Adverse reports on the toxicity of Synthalin prompted the development of Synthalin B (which had a slightly longer polymethylene chain and was claimed to be safer) and the former product was re-branded Synthalin A. However liver toxicity continued to be a problem, leading to discontinuation in the 1930s, though Synthalin B continued to be used in Germany until the mid-1940s.

===Anti-trypanosome===
After it was discovered{{when|date=June 2016}} that [[Trypanosomatid|trypanosome]]s require a plentiful supply of glucose in order to reproduce, researchers tested Synthalin and related compounds to see if they could be effective treatments. Synthalin was effective, at doses lower than would interfere with blood sugar in the patient.{{cn|date=June 2016}} Further modifications to the chemical structure led to the [[diamidine]] class of drugs, of which [[pentamidine]] is still used against [[trypanosomiasis]]. Pentamidine is also effective against a range of protozoa such as ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'', which causes [[pneumocystis pneumonia]] in [[AIDS]] patients.

'''Nesitanebetashru''' ''(ns-t3-nb.t-ỉšrw)'' was the name of two [[ancient Egypt]]ian women. The name means “belonging to the lady of the ''ashru''”; the ''ashru'' or ''[[isheru]]'' was a crescent-shaped sacred lake around the temples of solar goddesses, here it refers to [[Mut]].

Nesitanebetashru of the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]] was a daughter of [[Pinedjem II]], High Priest of Amun, and [[Neskhons]]. She is mentioned in the funerary text of her mother, written on a wooden tablet. Her mummy, coffins and [[ushabti]]s were found in the tomb [[TT320]] and are now in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{dodson}}, p.208&lt;/ref&gt;

Nesitanebetashru of the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd dynasty]] was the wife of Pharaoh [[Sheshonk II]] and the mother of Pharaoh [[Harsiese A]]. She was also a Chantress of Amun. She is mentioned on a statue of [[Bes]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton; op.cit., p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Wrong year. It was not published in 2018. Got rid of the &quot;The Lifetime&quot; bit in the upper right corner. The poem is by Arnold. It was published in 1853 and I'm not sure why the author was listed as &quot;YashSingh.&quot; I still need to find the publisher.</comment>

&quot;'''The Scholar Gipsy'''&quot; (1853) is a poem by [[Matthew Arnold]], based on a 17th-century [[Oxford]] story found in [[Joseph Glanvill]]'s ''The Vanity of Dogmatizing'' (1661, etc.). It has often been called one of the best and most popular of Arnold's poems,&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Churchill ''English Literature of the Nineteenth Century'' (London: University Tutorial Press, 1951) p. 140; Mary Moorman ''Poets and Historians: A Family Inheritance'' (Lincoln: Tennyson Society, 1974) p. 11; A. G. George ''Studies in Poetry'' (London: Heinemann Educational, 1971) p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also familiar to music-lovers through [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' choral work ''[[An Oxford Elegy]]'', which sets lines from this poem and from its companion-piece, &quot;[[Thyrsis (poem)|Thyrsis]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980) p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original story ==

Arnold prefaces the poem with an extract from [[Joseph Glanvill|Glanvill]] which tells the story of an impoverished Oxford student who left his studies to join a band of [[Romani people|gipsies]], and so ingratiated himself with them that they told him many of the secrets of their trade. After some time he was discovered and recognised by two of his former Oxford associates, who learned from him that the gipsies &quot;had a traditional kind of learning among them, and could do wonders by the power of imagination, their fancy binding that of others.&quot;  When he had learned everything that the gipsies could teach him, he said, he would leave them and give an account of these secrets to the world.

In 1929 [[Marjorie Hope Nicolson]] identified the original of this mysterious figure as the Flemish alchemist [[Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont|Francis Mercury van Helmont]].&lt;ref&gt;The Real Scholar Gipsy by Marjorie Nicolson in ''Yale Review'' vol. 18 (1929) pp. 347–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Arnold begins &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; in [[pastoral]] mode, invoking a shepherd and describing the beauties of a rural scene, with Oxford in the distance. He then repeats the gist of Glanvill's story, but extends it with an account of rumours that the scholar gipsy was again seen from time to time around Oxford. Arnold imagines him as a shadowy figure who can even now be glimpsed in the Berkshire and Oxfordshire countryside, &quot;waiting for the spark from Heaven to fall&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Line 120&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to have once seen him himself. He entertains a doubt as to the scholar gypsy's still being alive after two centuries, but then shakes off the thought. He cannot have died:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For what wears out the life of mortal men?&lt;br/&gt;'Tis that from change to change their being rolls:&lt;br/&gt;'Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,&lt;br/&gt;Exhaust the energy of strongest souls,&lt;br/&gt;And numb the elastic powers.&lt;ref&gt;Line 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The scholar gipsy, having renounced such a life, is 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,&lt;br/&gt;Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings,&lt;ref&gt;Line 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
and is therefore not subject to ageing and death.  Arnold describes
&lt;blockquote&gt;this strange disease of modern life,&lt;br/&gt;With its sick hurry, its divided aims,&lt;ref&gt;Line 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and implores the scholar gipsy to avoid all who suffer from it, in case he too should be infected and die.  Arnold ends with an extended simile of a Tyrian merchant seaman who flees from the irruption of Greek competitors to seek a new world in Iberia.

== Writing and publication ==

&quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; was written in 1853, probably immediately after &quot;[[Sohrab and Rustum]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Allott]] and Miriam Allott (eds.) ''The Poems of Matthew Arnold'' (London: Longman, 1979) p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an 1857 letter to his brother [[Tom Arnold (academic)|Tom]], referring to their friendship with Theodore Walrond and the poet [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], Arnold wrote that &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; was &quot;meant to fix the remembrance of those delightful wanderings of ours in the [[Cumnor|Cumner]] hills before they were quite effaced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Epstein Nord ''Gypsies and the British Imagination, 1807–1930'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2006) pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold revisited these scenes many years later in his elegy for Arthur Hugh Clough, &quot;[[Thyrsis (poem)|Thyrsis]]&quot;, a companion-piece and, some would say,&lt;ref&gt;For example [[George Saintsbury]] in ''Matthew Arnold'' (Teddington: Echo Library, 2006) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; a sequel to &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot;. 

&quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot;, like &quot;Requiescat&quot; and &quot;[[Sohrab and Rustum]]&quot;, first appeared in Arnold's ''Poems'' (1853), published by [[Longman]]s. During the 20th century it was many times published as a booklet, either by itself or with &quot;Thyrsis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=matthew+arnold&amp;ti=scholar+gipsy&amp;sort-order=date Catalogue entry] at [[Copac]].&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse|The Oxford Book of English Verse]]'' and in some editions of [[Francis Turner Palgrave|Palgrave]]'s ''[[Palgrave's Golden Treasury|Golden Treasury]]'' despite its being, at 250 lines, considerably longer than most of the poems in either anthology.

== Critical opinions ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Homer ''animates'' – Shakespeare ''animates'', in its poor way I think [[Sohrab and Rustum]] ''animates'' – the &quot;Gipsy Scholar&quot; at best awakens a pleasing melancholy. But this is not what we want.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The complaining millions of men&lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Darken in labour and pain –&lt;br/&gt;what they want is something to ''animate'' and ''ennoble'' them –  not merely to add zest to their melancholy or grace to their dreams.&lt;br/&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Matthew Arnold&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], November 1853, cited from Carl Dawson (ed.) ''Matthew Arnold: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995) vol. 2, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We would ask Mr. Arnold to consider whether the acceptance this poem is sure to win, does not prove to him that it is better to forget all his poetic theories, ay, and [[Homer]] and [[Sophocles]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] too, and speak straight out of things which he has felt and tested on his own pulses.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''The North British Review''&lt;ref&gt;Unsigned review, possibly by [[Coventry Patmore]] or [[John Campbell Shairp|J. C. Shairp]], from ''[[The North British Review]]'', August 1854, cited from Carl Dawson (ed.) ''Matthew Arnold: The Critical Heritage'' (London: Routledge, 1995) vol. 2, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; has sunk into the common consciousness; it is inseparable from Oxford; it is the poetry of Oxford made, in some sense, complete.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[John William Mackail]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John William Mackail|J. W. Mackail]] ''Lectures on Poetry'' (London: Longmans, 1911) p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; represents very closely the ghost of each one of us, the living ghost, made up of many recollections and some wishes and promises; the excellence of the study is in part due to the poet's refusal to tie his wanderer to any actual gipsy camp or any invention resembling a plot.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Edmund Blunden]]&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold ''The Scholar-Gipsy'' (London: Nicholson &amp; Watson, 1933) pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What the poem actually offers is a charm of relaxation, a holiday from serious aims and exacting business.  And what the Scholar-Gipsy really symbolises is Victorian poetry, vehicle (so often) of explicit intellectual and moral intentions, but unable to be in essence anything but relaxed, relaxing and anodyne.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
[[F. R. Leavis]]&lt;ref&gt;[[F. R. Leavis]] ''The Common Pursuit'', cited from [[Harold Bloom]] (ed.) ''The Art of the Critic: Literary Theory and Criticism from the Greeks to the Present'' (New York: Chelsea House, 1985–1990) vol. 9, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==
Margret Boveri was born in [[Würzburg]], [[German Empire|Germany]], the daughter of German biologist [[Theodor Boveri]] and American biologist [[Marcella Boveri|Marcella O'Grady Boveri]]. Her father died in 1915 and her mother returned to the USA in 1925. She studied history and political science in Munich and Berlin. From 1934 she worked in the Foreign Affairs section of the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'' newspaper, where she was promoted by the editor, [[Paul Scheffer]].&lt;ref name = ges&gt;Heike B. Görtemaker: ''Ein deutsches Leben. Die Geschichte der Margret Boveri, München'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1939 until 1943 (when the newspaper was banned) she worked as foreign correspondent for the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' newspaper in [[Stockholm]] and [[New York City]]. She was awarded the [[War Merit Medal]] by the [[Nazi]] Government in 1941; she herself was never a member of the Nationalist Socialist Party. After the USA entered the war she was interned for a time in New York, before being returned, at her own request, to Europe. In May 1942 she arrived in [[Lisbon]], where she continued her work as correspondent for the ''Frankfurter Zeitung''. While in Lisbon she became acquainted with the Swiss journalist [[Annemarie Schwarzenbach]], who was to die shortly afterwards in an accident in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Gillessen, Günther: ''Auf verlorenem Posten. Die Frankfurter Zeitung im Dritten Reich''. Berlin 1986, p. 479 et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' was banned by the German government in 1943, Boveri returned to Berlin, where her apartment was destroyed in an air strike. She then took up work as a report writer in the German embassy in [[Madrid]] before returning to Berlin in 1944 to work as a freelance writer with the National Socialist weekly ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]''.&lt;ref name = ges/&gt;

After the war Boveri disapproved of the division of Germany by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into separate political zones, in which she was supported by [[Konrad Adenauer]], and she maintained her opposition to the division of Germany until the 1960s. In 1968 she was awarded the [[German Critics' Prize]] and in 1970 the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]], the highest civilian honour in [[West Germany]], for promoting understanding between East and West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Heike B.

He was formed from a piece of clay that [[Enki|Ea]] had pinched off in the primeval ocean, in a tale recited as part of the ritual for restoring a temple, “when [[Anu]] created heaven.”
 
==The rituals==
 
The earliest attestations to the god whose specialty was to govern the fashioning of bricks and supervise the building process from start to finish was in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] myth 'Enki and the World Order' from the first dynasty of [[Isin]] which recalls that Enki put Kulla in charge of the pickaxe and brick-mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Foundation Deposits in Ancient Mesopotamia | author = Richard S. Ellis | publisher = Yale Press | year = 1968 | page = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was invoked when the laying of the foundation of buildings, and shooed-away upon their completion, lest his presence cause further construction to be required and other building work elsewhere to be neglected. In a ritual for the repair of a temple, the invocation is described:

{{ quotation|[I]f one has to open the foundations of a house, in a propitious month, on a favourable day, when he opens the foundations and lays the brick … you set up an offering arrangement to Kulla, the lord of foundations and brickwork, set out a censor of juniper, libate fine beer, scatter pressed-out sesame, cedar resin, cypress oil, honey, milk, wine, all kinds of stone, silver, gold and all kinds of aromatics into the River god, sacrifice a ram and pour its blood into the foundations.&lt;ref name=parpola&gt;{{ cite book | title = Letters from Assyrian Scholars to the Kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal Part II: Commentary and Appendices | author = Simo Parpola | publisher = Eisenbrauns | year = 2007 | pages = 279–280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In [[Esarhaddon]]’s account of the laying of the foundations of [[Esagil]], he recalls:

{{ quotation|I performed pure sacrifices to the great gods and Kulla, the lord of the fundament and the brickwork, I laid their foundations [upon a … mixed with] wind and choice beer, and made their superstructure durable.&lt;ref name=parpola/&gt; }}

A second ritual was often performed at the end of the work to drive away the god, with him unceremoniously “loaded” onto a boat and banished to the netherworld with incantations. The construction crew, too, were forbidden to approach the building for three days. Alternatively the divinities were thanked for their assistance and bidden to return from whence they came.

'''Albert Glotzer''' (1908–1999), also known as '''Albert Gates''' was a professional [[stenographer]] and founder of the [[Trotskyist]] movement in the United States. He was best remembered as the court reporter for the 1937 [[John Dewey Commission]] that examined the Stalinist charges against Trotsky in Mexico City and as a memoirist and activist in the [[social democratic]] movement in his later years.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Albert Glotzer was born November 7, 1908, to a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] family in [[Pinsk]], Belorussia (modern-day [[Belarus]]), then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Glotzer and his family emigrated to [[Chicago]] when he was four.

=== Political career ===

Politically active since childhood, he was selling [[socialist]] literature on the street corners by age eight, and joined the [[Young Communist League]] at fifteen.&lt;ref name=Wohlforth&gt;Tim Wohlforth, [http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/obituaries/obituaries/albert.htm &quot;Albert Glotzer (1908-1999): Obituary,&quot;] Revolutionary History, www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1920s Glotzer was elected a member of the National Executive Committee of the [[Young Workers League of America|Young Workers (Communist) League]].&lt;ref name=JoinOp&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1928/01dec1928.pdf &quot;Swabeck and Glotzer Join Opposition; Expelled,&quot;] ''The Militant,'' vol. 1, no. 2 (Dec. 1, 1928), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1928 Glotzer and his Chicago co-thinker [[Arne Swabeck]] expelled from the [[Communist Party USA|Workers (Communist) Party]] and its youth section for espousing [[Trotskyism]].&lt;ref name=Myers32&gt;Constance Ashton Myers, ''The Prophet's Army: Trotskyists in America, 1928-1941.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; News of the ouster of Glotzer and Swabeck was front-page news in the second issue of ''[[The Militant]],'' the first American Trotskyist newspaper.&lt;ref name=JoinOp /&gt;

Glotzer was a delegate to the founding convention of the [[Communist League of America (Opposition)]] (CLA) in May 1929 and was elected as one of five members of the governing National Council of the fledgling organization.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time Glotzer moved to [[New York City]] to work at the new organization's national office.&lt;ref name=Wohlforth /&gt;

Glotzer was involved in the factional difficulties that best the CLA from the very beginning. He originally gravitated toward [[James P. Cannon]] and Arne Swabeck, with whom he had worked in Chicago, but soon became a close ally of [[Max Shachtman]], who felt that Cannon was running the party in a bureaucratic and manner.

In 1931, Glotzer traveled with his wife to visit Leon Trotsky at [[Prinkipo]], Turkey, where he spent some weeks as a secretary and guard to the exiled Soviet leader.&lt;ref name=Wohlforth /&gt; According to Glotzer's wife they subsisted on the fish they caught in the [[Sea of Marmara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Glotzer obituary&quot;&gt;''Jewish Daily Forward'' [http://web.comhem.se/~u18606447/genealogy/texts/obit_ag.html Albert Glotzer obituary] March 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  Trotsky advised a truce between the two factions, and Glotzer returned to the US to go on a national speaking tour on the dangers of [[fascism]].

By June 1932 Glotzer's criticism of Cannon became explicit. Together with [[Martin Abern]] and Max Shachtman, Glotzer made charges that Cannon had showed signs of an &quot;ingrowing conservatism&quot; after 1928, taking long absences from party duty over &quot;personal difficulties&quot; and leaving operations in the hands of a tightly-knit group of close personal supporters who controlled criticism in the party press.&lt;ref name=Myers150&gt;Myers, ''The Prophet's Army,'' pg. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Abern, Glotzer, and Shachtman declared that &quot;new forces&quot; were needed to revitalize the flagging CLA.&lt;ref name=Myers150 /&gt; Relations between the top leaders were patched up at this juncture and no split of the organization ensued.

When the unity negotiations with [[A. J. Muste|A.J. Muste's]] [[American Workers Party]] began in 1934, Cannon and Shactman became factional allies. Glotzer felt alienated from the policy, however. He returned to Chicago but stayed loyal to the Trotskyist movement.&lt;ref name=Wohlforth /&gt;

In April 1937 the skilled [[stenographer]] Glotzer was sent to [[Mexico City]] to serve as [[court reporter]] at the [[Dewey Commission|John Dewey Commission]] called to hear charges made by the [[Joseph Stalin]] regime against Leon Trotsky. This commission heard evidence for a week before rendering a verdict clearing Trotsky of charges of espionage and sabotage levied against him in the ongoing [[Moscow Trials]]. The transcript produced by Glotzer was later published in book form by the American Trotskyist movement.

In the United States the Trotskyists emerged from the Socialist party as the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]]. After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi-Soviet Pact]] and the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]],  Shachtman, Abern, and others condemned the USSR's alliance with Nazi Germany and their cooperative invasion of Poland. Schachtman condemned the USSR's invasion of Finland. Viewing these invasions, Shachtman argued that the USSR was not a &quot;workers' state&quot;, but a new form of class-stratified society, &quot;[[bureaucratic collectivism]]&quot;, in which workers and peasants were exploited by a class of bureaucratic elites.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ryan [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/entries/glotz01.htm &quot;Albert Glotzer,&quot;] Encyclopedia of Trotskyism Online, Marxists Internet Archive, www.marxists.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Glotzer joined with Shachtman and helped to found the [[Workers Party (U.S.)|Workers Party]], later known as the [[Independent Socialist League]], which was absorbed by the Socialist Party in 1958. In 1972, the Socialist Party voted to rename itself [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA). Glotzer served on the SDUSA's National Committee for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;Dale Reed, [http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/9d/tf1t1n989d/files/tf1t1n989d.pdf &quot;Register of the Albert Glotzer papers,&quot;] Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death and legacy ===

Albert Glotzer died February 18, 1999. He was 90 years old at the time of his death.

Albert Glotzer's papers are housed in 67 archival boxes at the [[Hoover Institution Archives]] at [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. An on-line finding guide is available.&lt;ref name=Reed /&gt;

Besides remaining a speaker Glotzer was active in the stenographers union, [[Federation of Shorthand Reporters]], [[AFL-CIO]]. He served four terms as union president during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Glotzer obituary&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Jean-Louis Millette''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ lwi milɛt}}; 4 January 1935 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] &amp;ndash; 29 September 1999 in  Montreal) was a French-speaking actor and writer.&lt;ref name=Mtl/&gt;

Millette's television career spans over thirty years: he was a cast member of many of the best-known series in Quebec, including the children's series ''[[La Ribouldingue]]'' (which he also co-wrote), ''[[L'Héritage]]'', ''[[Symphorien (television series)|Symphorien]]'' and ''[[Montréal P.Q. (television series)|Montréal P.Q.]]'' (in a role which earned him a [[Prix Gémeaux]] in 1994).&lt;ref name=Mtl&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5238,23621567&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL&amp;pageType=2&amp;id_comedien=2|title=Jean-Louis Millette (1935 - 1999) |publisher=City of Montreal's website about &quot;La Roulotte&quot;|language=French|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=source lists Imdb as a source|date=December 2017}} He was also the voice of [[Abraham Simpson]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] and [[Waylon Smithers]] in the Quebec dubbing of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. On the big screen, he played mostly supporting roles, most notably in [[Robert Lepage]]'s first film ''[[The Confessional]] (Le Confessionnal)''.

However, Millette's most significant work was in theatre: he was a major figure of Quebec theatre and, in 1990, received the [[Prix Victor-Morin]] for outstanding achievement in theatre in Quebec. He was a member of the [[Théâtre de Quat'Sous]] when it was founded by [[Paul Buissonneau]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fse.uqam.ca/milieuxdefavorises/serie_C/13.html|title=Biographie de Jean-Louis Millette |date=1999-09-30|publisher=Presse Canadienne|language=French|accessdate=16 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millette died suddenly of a [[heart attack]] in September 1999. At the time, he was touring a one-man performance of [[Larry Tremblay]]'s ''[[The Dragonfly of Chicoutimi]]''. This role had earned him the [[Masque Prize]] (Quebec's annual prizes in theatre) for best acting performance.

'''''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing''''' is a [[boxing]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Glu Mobile|Sorrent]] for [[Mobile game|mobile phones]]. It was released in North America on August 22, 2004.

The game allows the player to choose to play as either [[George W. Bush]] or [[John Kerry]] to fight out the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States presidential election]]; the candidate chosen must fight through a number of preliminary rounds against the opponent's supporters in order to eventually fight the opposing candidate. ''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing'' garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. As of 2009, ''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing'' has received a 75.5% from [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush vs. Kerry Boxing for Mobile|publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/mobile/922005-bush-vs-kerry-boxing/index.html|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bush vs Kerry Boxing screen.jpg|thumb|left|The player fights [[Dick Cheney]].]]
''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing'' is for the most part a re-purposing of another [[Sorrent]] boxing title, ''[[Fox Sports Boxing]]'', with election characters instead of more standard pugilists.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot; /&gt; The game is a [[first person (video games)|first person]] [[boxing]] game; the game is seen from behind the player's gloves.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush vs. Kerry Boxing|author=Buchanan, Levi|date=August 30, 2004|publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/543/543284p1.html|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's view is filled by the opponent, as they dodge, punch, and counter against the player. Both the player and the opponent have a stamina meter, which as they perform actions is slowly drained.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt; The character is [[Knockout|KO'd]] after the stamina meter runs out unless the player can press the 0 button on the phone enough times to make a recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush vs. Kerry Boxing Review|author=Palley, Steve|date=August 25, 2004|publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/mobile/sports/bushvskerryboxing/review.html|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing'' features many prominent politicians from around the time of the 2004 Presidential election. The game gives the player the choice between playing as [[George W. Bush]] or [[John Kerry]], the two main candidates from the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt; The opponents the player faces change depending on which candidate he chooses to fight with; if the player chooses Bush, the player faces [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponents such as [[John Edwards]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], while if the player chooses Kerry, the player faces [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponents such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Dick Cheney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot; /&gt; [[Hillary Clinton]] is the game's [[Referee (boxing)|referee]], and [[Ralph Nader]] is the [[ring girl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt;

The game contains a national polling system, which tracks online how many times each candidate is beaten by players. The game keeps track of both local and national results.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==
''Bush vs. Kerry Boxing'' garnered positive reaction from critics who praised the game's humor and light-hearted approach to the election; it received a 75.5% from [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot; /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Steve Palley felt that the game struck up a good balance between humor and gameplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS&quot; /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Levi Buchanan thought that the game was a &quot;great goof&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt;

'''HMS ''Surinam''''' was a [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|''Cruizer''-class brig-sloop]] built by Obadiah Ayles at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]], [[Exeter]] and launched in 1805.&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield (2008), p.292.&lt;/ref&gt; She captured one privateer during her twenty-year career and took part in two campaigns before she was broken up in 1825. 

==Napoleonic Wars==
In March 1805 Commander Alexander Shippard commissioned ''Surinam'' for the Channel and then the Mediterranean. In September ''Srinam'' captured the ''Merchant'' , master, which was sailing from New York, and sent her into Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4254.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1805/09-17-1805.jpg].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shippard was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 22 January 1806. However, he was still aboard ''Surinam'' when she captured the ''Juliana'' on 28 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16330|date=2 January 1810|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier ''Surinam'' had captured the ''Venus'', Robhen, master, which had been sailing from St Bartholomews, and sent her into Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4301.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1806/02-28-1806.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surinam{{'}}''s next captain was briefly Commander H. Higman, and he was soon replaced by Commander John Lake in February 1806.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; 

On 11 May 1806. ''Surinam'' captured three vessels: ''Pacifico'', ''Tomasa'' and ''Alexandro''. Then six days later she captured the ''San Domingo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15999|date=10 February 1807|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''San Domingo'' was a schooner from Bilbao. ''Surinam'' also captured two luggers from Bilbao that may or may not be among the three vessels that she capture in May.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4058.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1806/06-03-1806.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; Next, ''Surinam'' captured the ''Anne Marie'', Claasson, master, from St Thomas, and the Spanish lugger ''Alexander'', and sent them into Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4061.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1806/06-13-1806.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, ''Surinam'' detained the Danish vessel ''Constantia'', Hankow, master, which had been sailing from St Croix to Copenhagen, and sent her into Plymouth too.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4062.[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1806/06-17-1806.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July ''Surinam'' was present or in sight at the capture of the French frigate [[French frigate Rhin (1802)|''Rhin'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16056|date=15 August 1807|page=1075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December, while ''Surinam'' west of [[Belle Île]] watching for the French fleet under Admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez|Willaumez]], lightning struck her. The strike killed two men, wounded four, destroyed a mast and damaged her badly.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1858), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1807 ''Surinam'' was attached to Admiral Lord [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Gardner]]’s fleet off southern Ireland. 

''Surinam'' left the fleet for Plymouth on 15 November. On 17 November, some 17 [[League (unit)|leagues]] north of [[Ushant]], she fell in with a French privateer. After a ten-hour chase ''Surinam'' captured the French vessel, which turned out to be the ''Amiral Dacrés'' (or ''Amiral Decrés''). The privateer was armed with fourteen 6-pounder guns and carried a crew of 76 men under the command of Jean G. Michel. She had sailed from [[St Malo]] the day before on her first cruise and had made no captures.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1555 |issue=16089|date=21 November 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the capture, [[HMS Pomone (1805)|''Pomone'']] was in sight.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16313|date=7 November 1809|page=1787}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 22 October, ''Surinam'' captured the ''Jane and Eleanor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16313|date=7 November 1809|page=1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 1808, ''Surinam'' captured the French sloop ''Sta. Anna'' or ''Sta. Joseph Marie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16382|date=26 June 1810|pages=947–948}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier, ''Surinam'' had detained the ''Grace, Brown, master'', which had been sailing from New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4224,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/29-1-1808.jpg] - accessed 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July ''Surinam'' was in company with {{HMS|Shannon|1806|2}} and {{HMS|Eclair|1801|2}} when ''Shannon'' captured ''Comet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16507|date=23 July 1811|page=1411}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then on 21 August, ''Surinam'' was in company with ''Shannon'' and {{HMS|Martial|1805|2}} when ''Shannon'' captured ''Espoir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16341|date=10 January 1810|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November ''Surinam'' captured the sloop ''Jeune Henry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16382|date=26 June 1810|page=946}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the ''John &amp; Harry'', from Guadeloupe that ''Lloyd's List'' reported arriving at Plymouth on 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4302,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/18-11-1808.jpg] - accessed 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next month, on 15 December, ''Surinam'' sailed for the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; She arrived there on 26 January 1809 after having left delivered the vessels she was convoying to Berbice, Demerara, and Surinam.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4337,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/21-3-1809.jpg] - accessed 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She had left the rest of the convoy, which was going to other destinations, on 5 January.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4329,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/21-2-1809.jpg] - accessed 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surinam'' was at the capture of [[Invasion of Martinique (1809)|Martinique]] in February 1809. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Martinique&quot; to all naval survivors of that campaign.

On 17 February 1810 ''Suriname'', {{HMS|Frolic|1806|2}}, and {{HMS|Superieure|1803|2}} joined Captain [[William Charles Fahie]] of {{HMS|Abercrombie|1807|2}} and his force at the surrender of [[Saint Martin]]. Fahie then entrusted ''Surinam'' with the despatches to Vice-Admiral The Honorable [[Alexander Cochrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16356|date=31 March 1810|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By virtue of this action, ''Surinam'' effectively also participated in the [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1810)|capture of Guadeloupe]] in January and February 1810.{{refn|A first-class share of the prize money for Guadaloupe was worth £113 3s 1¼d; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth £1 9s 1¼d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=24 September 1814|issue=16938|pages=1923–1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} In 1847 the [[Admiralty]] awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Guadaloupe&quot; to all surviving participants of the campaign.

In 1810, Commander A. Hodge (or Hedge) took command,&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-376871&quot;/&gt; and the next year she visited her namesake country of [[Suriname]], in South America. His replacement, in 1811, was A. Kennedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-376871&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_iv.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 376871|work=Warship Histories, vol iv|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110802041617/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_iv.pdf|archivedate=2 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812, Commander John Ellis Watt took command on the Leeward Islands station and sailed her for the coast of Guyana. 

In August 1812 ''Surinam'' was in company with {{HMS|Swaggerer|1809|2}} when they captured four American vessels:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=1534|issue=16760|date=3 August 1813}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''General Hamilton'' (11 August), lying at [[Paramaribo]], Suriname, carrying a cargo of molasses;
*''Mary'' (11 August), lying at Paramaribo, Suriname, in ballast;
*''Pochohantes'' (12 August), lying at Braams Point, Suriname, and carrying a cargo of salt; and
*''Mercator'' (24 August), bound to Baltimore, laden with molasses.
Watt died in September 1813 on his passage home after eight years in the West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;''The gentleman's magazine and historical chronicle'', Vol. 83, part 2, p.504.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1812, ''Surinam'' was near Surinam when she encountered the American privateer ''Montgomery'', which was under the command of Captain Upton. ''Montgomery'' was armed with two long 12-pounder guns and ten 6-pounders. ''Surinam'' gave chase until a shot from ''Montgomery'' struck and so weakened ''Surinam{{'}}''s foremast that she gave up the pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Maclay (1900), p.379.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surinam'' encountered the American privateer ''Governor Tompkins'', of ten 9-pounder guns and 90 men, on 20 May 1813 off the coast of Surinam. After an engagement of some 45 minutes, ''Governor Tompkins'' was able to escape. Earlier, on 8 May, ''Governor Tompkins'' had captured the ''Hartley'', Grayson, master, which was sailing from Gibraltar to Bahia. The privateer burnt the ''Hartley'', and on 24 May deposited Captain Grayson and his crew at Grenada. ''Governor Tompkins'' then sailed for America, having been cruising for some three months.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no. 4787,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/07-16-1813.jpg] - accessed 16 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September ''Surinam'' and {{HMS|Grampus|1802|6}} arrived off Portsmouth with 37 vessels that they had escorted from the Leeward Islands.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's List'', no.4805,[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1813/17-9-1813.jpg] - accessed 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 ''Surinam'' returned to Britain. From October 1815 she was [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]] at Sheerness.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Post-war==
Between 1817 and 1820 ''Surinam'' was at Chatham.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMM-WH-376871&quot;/&gt; On 18 November 1820 Commander William Mackenzie Godfrey took command and sailed for the West Indies. He was promoted to [[post-captain]] on 19 July 1822 and Commander Alfred Matthews replaced him. Commander Charles Crole succeeded him from April 1823. By 1825 ''Surinam'' was back at Chatham.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Fate==
On 22 June 1825 the Navy Office offered her for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18149|date=25 June 1825|page=1109}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sold on 20 July 1825 at Chatham for £1,450 to John Small Sedger for breaking up.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

As the author of this article I would like to request to move it back into my user space until I complete some of the tie in articles I wish to write. My series would include, The Final Solution (Jason Bailey), Final Solution (Lawrence Graham), and Final Solution (Richard Peck). The idea of these articles is to compare the difference between the coined term &quot;Final Solution&quot; historically to the fictional uses for it in literature. I understand that the article does not appear notable on its own but I believe when it is included in my series, this topic of comparison will be notable. I will wait until I get your permission before moving the article back to my user space.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Gaul god Sucellus.jpg|thumb|right|The Celtic god [[Sucellus]].]]
'''Muna''' (Mona, Muma) is one of the goddesses of [[Celtic polytheism]], associated heavily with the [[written word]].  She is also the largest influence and likely synonymous with multiple [[Fairy|fae]] whose folk roots are a [[religion]] of the [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]s.  These fae's most notable influence was as a protector of lost children. Like other [[Iron Age]] Europeans, the early Celts maintained a [[polytheistic]] mythology and religious structure. Among Celts in close contact with [[Ancient Rome]], such as the [[Gaul]]s and [[Celtiberians]], their mythology did not survive the [[Roman empire]], their subsequent conversion to [[Christianity]], and the loss of their [[Celtic languages]]. It is mostly through contemporary Roman and Christian sources that their mythology has been preserved. The Celts peoples who maintained either their political or linguistic identities (such as the [[Gaels]] and [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] tribes of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]) left vestigial remnants of their forebears' mythologies, put into written form during the [[Middle Ages]].  Muna was the inspiration for the naming of the province [[Munster]] in [[Ireland]].

==Overview==
Though the Celtic world at its apex covered much of western and central Europe, it was not politically unified nor was there any substantial central source of cultural influence or homogeneity; as a result, there was a great deal of variation in local practices of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]] (although certain motifs, for example the god [[Lugh]], appear to have diffused throughout the Celtic world). Inscriptions to more than three hundred deities, often equated with their Roman counterparts, have survived, but of these most appear to have been ''[[genius loci|genii locorum]]'', local or tribal gods, and few were widely worshipped. However, from what has survived of Celtic mythology, it is possible to discern commonalities which hint at a more unified pantheon than is often given credit.

[[File:Robert Ker Porter.jpg|thumb|230px|Self portrait of Robert Ker Porter]]
'''Sir Robert Ker Porter''', [[Royal Guelphic Order|KCH]] (1777–1842) was a British artist, author, diplomat and traveller. Known today for his accounts of his travels in Russia, Spain, and Persia, he was one of the earliest panorama painters in Britain, was appointed historical painter to Tsar Alexander I of Russia and served as British consul in [[Venezuela]].

==Early life==
Porter was born in [[Durham, England|Durham]] in 1777, one of the five children of William Porter, an army surgeon. His sisters were the writers [[Jane Porter]] and [[Anna Maria Porter]]. His father died in 1779, and the following year his mother took him to Edinburgh, although he attended [[Durham School]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He decided that he wanted to become a painter of battle scenes, and in 1790 his mother took him to see [[Benjamin West]], who thought enough of his sketches to procure him admission as a student at the [[Royal Academy]].  In 1792 he received a silver palette from the [[Society of Arts]] for a drawing entitled ''The Witch of Endor''. In 1793 he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for Shoreditch church; in 1794 he painted ''Christ allaying the Storm'' for the Roman Catholic chapel at [[Portsea, Portsmouth]]; and in 1798 ''St. John Preaching'' for [[St John's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Panoramas and historical paintings==
[[File:Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie by Sir Robert Ker Porter (detail).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Detail from the &quot;Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie&quot; by Sir Robert Ker Porter]]
In 1800 he obtained work as a scene-painter at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], and in the same year caused a sensation when his ''Storming of Seringapatam'', a panorama  {{convert|120|ft|m}} long, carried round three-quarters of a circle, was exhibited at the Lyceum. It was painted, according to his sister [[Jane Porter|Jane]], in six weeks. Other successful works in the same format were the ''Battle of Lodi'' (1803), also exhibited at the Lyceum, and the ''Defeat of the French at the Devil's Bridge, Mont St. Gothard, by Suwarrow in 1804''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also showed several pictures at the [[Royal Academy]] including ''Death of [[Sir Philip Sydney]]'' in 1792, ''The Defeat of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]]'' in 1793, and the ''[[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]]'' in 1796.

==Russia, Spain, Caucasus and Persia==
In 1804 he was appointed historical painter to Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] of Russia.  In St Petersburg he was employed upon some vast historical paintings for the Admiralty Hall. During his residence in the city he won the affections of a Russian princess, Mary, daughter of Prince Theodor von Scherbatoff but complications connected with their courtship necessitated his leaving Russia, whereupon he travelled in Finland and Sweden, and he was knighted by King [[Gustavus IV]] in 1806. He then visited several German courts, and in 1807 was created a knight of St Joachim of Würtemberg.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

While in Sweden he had got to know General Sir John Moore, whom he accompanied to Spain. He was with the military expedition throughout, was present at the Battle of Coruña and the death of the general, and made many sketches of the campaign. In the meantime his ''Travelling Sketches in Russia and Sweden during the years 1805–1808'' had appeared in 1809, elaborately illustrated by the author. It was soon followed by ''Letters from Portugal and Spain, written during the march of the troops under Sir John Moore''. In 1811 he returned to Russia, and on 7 February 1812 he married his Russian princess (who was to die of [[typhus]] at St. Petersburg in September 1826). He mixed in Russian military and diplomatic circles, and became well acquainted with the Russian version of the events of 1812–13, of which he gave an account in his ''Narrative of the Campaign in Russia during 1812''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Tomb of Cyrus by Ker Porter.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the [[tomb of Cyrus]], 1818]]
He had returned to England before the appearance of this book, and on 2 April 1813 he was knighted by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. He was soon abroad again, and in August 1817 he left from St. Petersburg on a long journey which took him through the Caucasus to Teheran, and then southwards via Ispahan to the site of the ancient [[Persepolis]], where he made drawings and transcribed a number of cuneiform inscriptions. After a stay at Shiraz, he returned to Ispahan, and proceeded to Ecbatana and Bagdad, and then, following the route of [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Katabasis]]'', to [[Shkodër|Scutari]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was the first person to locate the [[tomb of Cyrus|mausoleum of Cyrus the Great]] in [[Pasargadae]] near [[Shiraz]].&lt;ref&gt;N. K. Shahbazi, Comprehensive Guide of Parseh, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; He published an account of his journey in ''Travels in Georgia, Persia, Armenia, Ancient Babylonia, 1817–1820''.  At Tehran he had an audience with the Persian monarch [[Fath Ali Shah]], whose portrait he drew, and from whom 1819 he received the order of the Lion and the Sun.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Venezuela==
After returning to England, he soon left again for Russia, but in 1826 he was appointed British consul in Venezuela, a position he held for fifteen years. He continued to paint during this period, his works including several large religious pieces, and a portrait of [[Simón Bolívar]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Porter, Robert Ker|last=Seccombe|first=Thomas |no-icon=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Europe==
He returned to England in 1841. After a short stay with his brother at Bristol, he went to visit his daughter, who had married a Russian army officer, in St Petersburg. On 3 May 1842 he wrote from St Petersburg to his brother that he was about to sail for England, but died suddenly the next day as he was returning in his [[drosky]] from a farewell visit to Emperor Nicholas I. He was buried in St. Petersburg, and a monument was erected to his memory in [[Bristol Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''{{Not a typo|The The}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ð|ə|_|ð|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;Pronunciation heard in a conversation between Matt Johnson and Johnny Marr https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GMzBboCJTC4&lt;/ref&gt; are an English [[post-punk]] band. They have been active in various forms since 1979, with singer/songwriter [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] being the only constant band member. The The achieved critical acclaim and commercial success in the UK, with 15 chart singles (seven reaching the Top 40), and their most successful album, ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'' (1986), spent 30 weeks on the chart. They followed this with the Top Ten albums ''[[Mind Bomb]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dusk (The The album)|Dusk]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=555|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The early years (1977–1981)===
In November 1977, Matt Johnson placed an [[advertising|advertisement]] in ''[[NME]]'', asking for &quot;Bass/lead guitarist into [[The Velvet Underground]]/[[Syd Barrett]]&quot;. Johnson later placed a second advertisement in the ''NME'', stating his new influences as &quot;[[The Residents]]/[[Throbbing Gristle]]&quot;.

While trying to get his band going, in 1978 Johnson had recorded a demo solo [[album]] (''See Without Being Seen'') which he continued to sell at various underground gigs on cassettes. In 1979, working with Colin Lloyd-Tucker (a friend and colleague at [[De Wolfe Music]], the Soho music publisher/recording studio) Johnson recorded his first album proper, ''Spirits''. This album remains unreleased, although the album track &quot;What Stanley Saw&quot; was later licensed to [[Cherry Red Records]] for their ''Perspectives &amp; Distortion'' [[compilation album]], which also featured [[Virgin Prunes]], [[Lemon Kittens]], [[Thomas Leer]], [[Kevin Coyne]] and [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]].

{{Not a typo|The The}} made their debut at London's Africa Centre on 11 May 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thethe.com/sections/library/gigography/gigography.html |title=This Is {{Not a typo|The The}} Day – Library |publisher=Thethe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717040926/http://www.thethe.com/sections/library/gigography/gigography.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; third on the bill to [[Scritti Politti]] and [[PragVEC]], using backing tape tracks that Johnson created at his day job at De Wolfe studios for the drums and bass. The band at this point consisted of Johnson on vocal, electric piano, guitar and tapes and [[Keith Laws]] on synthesiser and tapes. It was Keith Laws who suggested the name '{{not a typo|the The}}' to Matt Johnson.

As {{Not a typo|the The}} was now getting underway, Johnson was simultaneously working with experimental synth-pop combo The Gadgets, a studio group he formed with Colin Lloyd Tucker, his colleague at De Wolfe recording studios.

[[Peter Ashworth]], then known as 'Triash' and later to become a noted photographer, became {{Not a typo|the The's}} drummer in 1980, and Tom Johnston (also managing {{Not a typo|The The}} at this point and later to become a cartoonist for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspapers) was added on bass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both Ashworth and Johnston were credited with appearing on {{Not a typo|The The's}} debut single (&quot;Controversial Subject&quot;/&quot;Black and White&quot;) on [[4AD|4AD Records]] neither actually played on the [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]], which were produced by [[Wire (band)|Wire]] members [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]]. All [[musical instrument|instruments]] were played by Johnson and Laws. Johnston and Ashworth soon dropped out of {{Not a typo|the The}} and returned to their respective day jobs. As a duo (Johnson and Laws), {{Not a typo|The The}} began performing concerts with [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[This Heat]], [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] and [[Scritti Politti]].

In early 1981 {{Not a typo|The The}} also contributed the composition ‘Untitled’ to the [[Some Bizzare Album]]. In September of that year Johnson and Laws signed a deal with [[Some Bizzare Records]] and released the 7&quot; single &quot;Cold Spell Ahead&quot;. By this stage Matt Johnson had begun playing all the instruments himself so Laws left to pursue his studies, leaving Johnson as a solo artist using a group moniker.

Johnson was signed up later in 1981 to 4AD Records by [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] to record a solo album, ''[[Burning Blue Soul]]''. Although all of the instruments and vocals were performed by Johnson, the album featured various producers including Wire's [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]], Ivo and Johnson himself. Years later, owing to a request from Johnson, so that all of his albums would be in the same rack together, it would be re-issued and credited to {{Not a typo|The The}}.

Towards the end of 1981, Colin Lloyd-Tucker and [[Simon Fisher-Turner]] joined the band for a series of stripped down {{Not a typo|The The}} acoustic concerts in London.

===The solo years (1982–1987)===
Now freed from the politics of a permanent group line-up, Johnson was able to take {{Not a typo|The The}} up to the next level, and spent the next few years collaborating with a diverse range of creative individuals, freely changing personnel from project to project.

{{Not a typo|The The's}} next single was a retooling of &quot;Cold Spell Ahead&quot;, now entitled &quot;Uncertain Smile&quot;. Produced in New York by [[Mike Thorne]]; it reached No.&amp;nbsp;68 UK. This version is different from the more familiar album version, and featured sax and flute by session player [[Crispin Cioe]] rather than (as on the album version) the piano of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]]'s [[Jools Holland]].

In 1982, the intended debut album by {{Not a typo|the The}} (''The Pornography of Despair'') was recorded, but was never officially mixed nor released.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.interzone23.com/thethe/albums.html {{Not a typo|The The}} Discography – Albums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107023657/http://www.interzone23.com/thethe/albums.html |date=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson apparently ran off some cassette copies for friends, and several tracks were subsequently re-recorded and issued as b-sides, but the original album remains unmixed and unissued. [[Steve James Sherlock]] played flute and saxophone on the re-recordings of &quot;Three Orange Kisses From Kazan&quot; and &quot;Waitin' For The Upturn&quot;, two of the songs from the album which saw the light of day as b-sides.

Around 1982 The The played a series  of 4 concerts at the Marque Club in Wardour Street, Soho entitled 'An evening of Rock n Roll with The The'. These concerts were weekly for 4 weeks and featured Marc Almond on guitar and vocals.  

{{Not a typo|The The}} released their official album debut, the synth-noir classic ''[[Soul Mining]]'', in 1983. It featured the minor UK No.&amp;nbsp;71 hit &quot;[[This Is the Day (song)|This Is the Day]]&quot;, as well as a new recording of {{Not a typo|The the}} performing &quot;Uncertain Smile&quot;. Produced by Johnson and [[Paul Hardiman]], it featured guest appearances from [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]'s drummer [[Zeke Manyika]], [[Jools Holland]], [[Thomas Leer]] and [[J. G. Thirlwell]] (aka [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]]).

During {{Not a typo|the The's}} more prolific period of releases, from ''Soul Mining'' (1983) to ''Dusk'' (1992), most artwork used on the albums and single releases was produced by Johnson's brother [[Andy Dog Johnson|Andrew Johnson]], using the pseudonym Andy Dog. The artwork has a distinctive style, and sometimes courted controversy, most notably the initial release of the 1986 single &quot;Infected&quot; which featured a masturbating devil and was withdrawn from sale and re-issued with an edited version of the same drawing.

For the 1986 album ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'', {{Not a typo|the The}} still consisted only of Johnson, but was augmented by session musicians and featured friends such as Manyika and [[Rip Rig + Panic]] singer [[Neneh Cherry]] and [[Anna Domino]]. This album spawned four charting singles in the UK, notably &quot;Heartland&quot;, which made the UK Top 30.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; It was also unusual for having a full-length accompanying film. Costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, ''Infected: The Movie'' was shot on locations in Bolivia, Peru and New York. Different songs were directed by different directors, mainly [[Tim Pope]] and [[Peter Christopherson|Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson]] (of [[Throbbing Gristle]]).

Throughout 1986-1987 Johnson toured the world extensively with ''Infected: The Movie'', showing the film in cinemas in place of performing live concerts. The film was also shown twice in its entirety on [[Channel 4]] in the UK and on [[MTV]]'s [[120 Minutes]] in the [[United States|US]].

In 1987 Johnson also took some tentative steps back into live performance. Whilst promoting ''Infected: The Movie'' in Australia he had a chance encounter with [[Billy Bragg]] who persuaded him to return to Britain and support [[Red Wedge]], a coalition of like-minded musicians supporting the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in its election campaign. Johnson agreed and enrolled longtime friend and collaborator Manyika to join him in performing shows in London featuring stripped down versions of political {{Not a typo|The the}} songs such as &quot;Heartland&quot;. This experience convinced Johnson to put a band together once again.

===Return to a full band (1988–2002)===
By 1988, {{Not a typo|the The}} was an actual band again, Johnson having recruited ex-[[The Smiths|Smiths]] guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], ex-[[Nick Lowe]] bassist [[James Eller]] and ex-[[ABC (band)|ABC]] drummer [[David Palmer (drummer)|David Palmer]] as fully-fledged members. This line-up, plus guest singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]], recorded the album ''[[Mind Bomb]]'', which debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and featured the band's highest charting single to that time, &quot;The Beat(en) Generation&quot;, which peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;18 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; The first single from ''[[Mind Bomb]]'' was actually scheduled to be &quot;Armageddon Days Are Here (again)&quot; but with its chorus of &quot;Islam is rising, the Christians mobilising&quot; and sensitivities over the [[Salman Rushdie]] affair that had recently erupted, this song was deemed unsuitable for release by Epic/CBS.

Keyboardist [[D.C. Collard]] was added to the official line-up in 1989 (keyboard player [[Steve Hogarth]], who'd played on ''[[Infected (The The album)|Infected]]'', had initially been asked to join but opted instead to become the new lead vocalist of [[Marillion]]). The band embarked on a lengthy world tour in 1989–90 called ''{{Not a typo|The The}} Versus The World''. The live film of the same name, directed by [[Tim Pope]], was filmed during the three nights {{Not a typo|The The}} performed at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] at the end of the tour. Vocalist Melanie Redmond, who had just completed a world tour with Duran Duran, joined the tour during the European leg as a session musician.

The studio EP ''Shades of Blue'' was released in 1990. This included cover versions of [[Fred Neil]]'s &quot;Dolphins&quot; and [[Duke Ellington]]'s &quot;Solitude&quot; as well as a new original song &quot;Jealous of Youth&quot; and a live version of &quot;Another Boy Drowning&quot; from ''Burning Blue Soul''. This and a later EP of remixes, 1993's ''Dis-infected'', were compiled into a 1994 full-length album for the North American market called ''Solitude''.

In 1993, the five-piece line-up (Johnson/Marr/Collard/Eller/Palmer) Some Bizzare Label / Epic issued the album ''[[Dusk ({{Not a typo|The The}} album)|Dusk]]'', which debuted at No.&amp;nbsp;2 in the UK and spun off three Top 40 singles in the UK,&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; led by &quot;Dogs of Lust&quot;. Another world tour followed, the ''Lonely Planet'' tour, at which point the band's line-up was reshuffled; Marr and Eller left, and were replaced by Atlanta-based guitarist [[Keith Joyner]] and New York bassist [[Jared Michael Nickerson]], respectively after Johnson relocated the band to America. Also added was Boston harmonica player [[Jim Fitting]] (formerly of [[Treat Her Right]]), who auditioned in New York in early 1993. The version of their hit &quot;This Is The Day&quot; featuring Jim Fitting was often dubbed &quot;''That Was'' The Day&quot;. Palmer bowed out partway through the tour and was replaced by ex [[Stabbing Westward]] drummer [[Andy Kubiszewski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The band headlined the main stage at the 1993 [[Reading Festival]].

Another full-length film, directed by longtime collaborator [[Tim Pope]], was made for this album. ''From Dusk Til Dawn'' was shot in New Orleans and New York, and along with Johnson and Johnny Marr also featured various characters from the New York underground scene such as sexologist [[Annie Sprinkle]], writer and raconteur [[Quentin Crisp]], [[Guardian Angels]] founder [[Curtis Sliwa]], and porn star Rick Savage amongst many other carnival characters.

Now permanently relocated to New York, {{Not a typo|The The's}} next project was 1995's ''[[Hanky Panky ({{Not a typo|The The}} album)|Hanky Panky]]'', an album that consisted entirely of [[Hank Williams]] cover tunes. ''Hanky Panky'' was recorded by a new group consisting of Johnson, Collard, Fitting, ex [[Iggy Pop]] guitarist [[Eric Schermerhorn]], ex [[David Bowie]] bass guitarist [[Gail Ann Dorsey]] (billed as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Dorsey), and drummer the &quot;Reverend&quot; [[Brian MacLeod (U.S. musician)|Brian MacLeod]]. Their cover version of &quot;I Saw The Light&quot; hit No.&amp;nbsp;31 UK.Released by Some Bizzare Label / Epic 

An experimental album called ''Gun Sluts'' was recorded in 1997, but left unreleased by the band after it was rejected for being too uncommercial by their label.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; {{Not a typo|The The}} severed their eighteen-year relationship with Sony and moved to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], on [[Trent Reznor]]'s [[Nothing Records]] imprint.

In 2000, {{Not a typo|The The}}, now consisting of Johnson, Schermerhorn, Nashville bassist Spencer Campbell and New Jersey drummer Earl Harvin, released ''[[NakedSelf]]'' and embarked on yet another lengthy world tour, the ''Naked Tour'', this one lasting 14 months. Not counting soundtrack albums, ''[[NakedSelf]]'' remains {{Not a typo|The The's}} final released studio album to date.

This same line-up also recorded two new tracks, &quot;Deep Down Truth&quot;, featuring [[Angela McCluskey]] on vocals and &quot;Pillar Box Red&quot;. Both songs were produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]] for the 2002 compilation album ''[[45 RPM: The Singles of {{Not a typo|The The}}]]''

In June 2002 {{Not a typo|The The}} made a sole live appearance at the [[Meltdown Festival]] at London's Royal Festival Hall as guests of [[David Bowie]]. At this point, the band consisted solely of Johnson and longtime friend and collaborator [[J. G. Thirlwell]] aka [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] on tapes and loops, and young film director [[Benn Northover]] on film and video.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

This was the last live performance by {{Not a typo|The The}} for sixteen years; Johnson had stated on the official {{Not a typo|The The}} web site in the FAQ section that &quot;There are no plans for one-off shows or tours in the near future but there will undoubtedly be another {{Not a typo|The The}} tour at some point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thethe.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10 |title=Thethe.com |publisher=Thethe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043314/http://www.thethe.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10 |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiatus (2003–2017)===
Since 2003 the reclusive Johnson has kept well away from the public eye and has concentrated primarily on soundtrack work, scoring numerous documentaries, films and art installations.

For Swedish filmmaker Johanna St Michaels this has included ''Best Wishes Bernhard'' (prize winning film of Dokumentär Films Premien Nordic Panorama 2003), ''Snapshots From Reality'' (Nominated for Best International Short at the [[Birds Eye View]] Film festival at London's [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] 2007) ''The Track'' (2007), ''Going Live'' (2008), ''The Island Amid the Worlds'' (2010) and ''Bilder av Dina'' (2010). The latest collaboration between Johnson and St Michaels, ''Penthouse North'' premiered at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] in May 2014.

In June 2009 it was announced that {{Not a typo|The The}} had created an original soundtrack to the ''[[Gerard Johnson (director)|Gerard Johnson]]'' debut feature film ''[[Tony (2009 film)|Tony]]''. The film was released in February 2010 to critical acclaim; [[Sight &amp; Sound]] said “If Mike Leigh remade Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer... Remarkable&quot;, [[The Guardian]] &quot;The perfect marriage of genre and style&quot; and [[The Independent]] “Grim, painful and uncomfortably funny”. The [[soundtrack]] was released on {{Not a typo|The The's}} Cineola imprint in March 2010, as volume one of several upcoming soundtrack and instrumental albums.

In May 2014 {{Not a typo|The The}} completed an original soundtrack for [[Gerard Johnson (director)|Gerard Johnson]]'s latest film, Hyena. Starring [[Peter Ferdinando]], [[Stephen Graham (actor)|Stephen Graham]] and [[Neil Maskell]], this controversial crime thriller about people trafficking and corrupt elements within the UK police opens up 2014's [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]]. The album was released on 6 March 2015 as the third part in the Cinéola series.

For English director [[Nichola Bruce]] it has included the documentary ''One Man Show: Dramatic Art of Steven Berkoff'' (1995) and a documentary feature film about the [[Apollo program|Apollo moon landings]], ''Moonbug'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nicholabruce.com/moonbug.html |title=Nicholabruce.com |publisher=Nicholabruce.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512163859/http://nicholabruce.com/moonbug.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was completed in autumn 2010 and won the Special Jury Remi Award for Theatrical Feature Documentary at the 2011 Houston International Film Festival. The soundtrack was released in 2012 as volume 2 in the series of original soundtrack albums produced through Johnson's Cineola imprint.
