<h4>Description of this demo search</h4>
<li>A documentation of how the search index was configured and built can be found
<a href="http://www.project-strus.net/wikipediaSearch.htm">here (building the strus Wikipedia demo search)</a>.</li>
<li>This is a demo system that has been built to show the performance of strus under conditions
of limited resources. <b>Older hardware</b> has been used, because a system pushed to its limits
is <b>better to judge</b>. Because the queries will not be very frequent on this system, the
chance that the engine has to access disk to retrieve the result, is very high. The size
of the index is 6 times bigger than the memory available.
Be aware of the size of the index (more than 15 million documents).
Normally a search index of this size would be split into smaller units.
If somebody thinks strus is slow, so be it.
This demo tries to address a public that is aware of what is happening here.</li>
<h4>Hardware description</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Motherboard: <a href="http://www.intel.com/cd/channel/reseller/apac/eng/products/server/boards/up/s3000ah/feature/index.htm">Intel S3000AHV</a></li>
<li>Processor: <a href="http://ark.intel.com/de/products/27203/Intel-Xeon-Processor-3040-2M-Cache-1_86-GHz-1066-MHz-FSB">1 Intel Xeon Processor 3040, 1.86 GHz</a></li>
<li>Memory: 8 GB DDR2 RAM, 533 MHz</li>
<li>Hard disc: Western Digial 2TB SATA, product number: WDC WD2002FYPS-0</li>
<li>Index size on disc: ~50G</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>Weighting schemas:</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>BM25</b>: <p>Classical BM25 with k1=0.75, b=2.1, avgdoclen=500 plus an extra weight added for link popularity: w=tanh(n/100), where n is the number of links pointing to the page (df of references). Return only documents that contain all query terms.</p>
</p></li>
<li><b>NBLNK</b>: <p>Extract links weighted according their appearance in sentences that contain query terms. The documents inspected are the best 100 documents evaluated with BM25 on documents containing all query terms.
The weighting of the links is done by accumulating weights of feature expressions build from pairs of query terms.
For a query with 4 terms, there are 14 query expressions built. For example for the query "Roger Federer", the
links are weighted as follows:
<ol>
<li>Links appearing in a sentence where the sequence "Roger Federer" ("Roger" followed immediately by "Federer") occurrs with weight 3.0</li>
<li>Links appearing in a sentence where "Roger" appears near "Federer" ins distance of maximum 5 with weight 2.0</li>
<li>Links appearing in a sentence where "Roger" appears near "Federer" ins distance of maximum 20 with weight 1.5</li>
</ol>
Weights of a specific link in a document are multiplied. The resulting weights are accumulated by summation for each link target found.
The links with the highest weight are returned as result.
</p></li>
</ol>
